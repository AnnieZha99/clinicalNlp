BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that in-lab motor skill acquisition 
(supervised by an experimenter) is sensitive to biomarkers of Alzheimer disease 
(AD). However, remote unsupervised screening of AD risk through a skill-based 
task via the web has the potential to sample a wider and more diverse pool of 
individuals at scale.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine a web-based motor skill game 
("Super G") and its sensitivity to risk factors of AD (eg, age, sex, APOE ε4 
carrier status, and verbal learning deficits).
METHODS: Emails were sent to 662 previous MindCrowd participants who had agreed 
to be contacted for future research and have their APOE ε4 carrier status 
recorded and those who were at least 45 years of age or older. Participants who 
chose to participate were redirected to the Super G site where they completed 
the Super G task using their personal computer remotely and unsupervised. Once 
completed, different Super G variables were derived. Linear and logistic 
multivariable regression was used to examine the relationship between available 
AD risk factors (age, sex, APOE ε4 carrier status, and verbal learning) and 
distinct Super G performance metrics.
RESULTS: Fifty-four participants (~8% response rate) from the MindCrowd 
web-based cohort (mean age of 62.39 years; 39 females; and 23 APOE ε4 carriers) 
completed 75 trials of Super G. Results show that Super G performance was 
significantly associated with each of the targeted risk factors. Specifically, 
slower Super G response time was associated with being an APOE ε4 carrier (odds 
ratio 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.44; P=.006), greater Super G time in target (TinT) was 
associated with being male (odds ratio 32.03, 95% CI 3.74-1192,61; P=.01), and 
lower Super G TinT was associated with greater age (β -3.97, 95% CI -6.64 to 
-1.30; P=.005). Furthermore, a sex-by-TinT interaction demonstrated a 
differential relationship between Super G TinT and verbal learning depending on 
sex (βmale:TinT 6.77, 95% CI 0.34-13.19; P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This experiment demonstrated that this web-based game, Super G, has 
the potential to be a skill-based digital biomarker for screening of AD risk on 
a large scale with relatively limited resources.

elegans model of Alzheimer's Disease.

Amyloid β (Aβ) is a peptide known for its characteristic aggregates in 
Alzheimer's Disease and its ability to induce a wide range of detrimental 
effects in various model systems. However, Aβ has also been shown to induce some 
beneficial effects, such as antimicrobial properties against pathogens. In this 
work, we explore the influence of Aβ in stress resistance in a C. elegans model 
of Alzheimer's Disease. We found that C. elegans that express human Aβ exhibit 
increased resistance to heat and anoxia, but not to oxidative stress. This 
beneficial effect of Aβ was driven from Aβ in neurons, where the level of 
induction of Aβ expression correlated with stress resistance levels. 
Transcriptomic analysis revealed that this selective stress resistance was 
mediated by the Heat Shock Protein (HSPs) family of genes. Furthermore, 
neuropeptide signaling was necessary for Aβ to induce stress resistance, 
suggesting neuroendocrine signaling plays a major role in activating organismal 
stress response pathways. These results highlight the potential beneficial role 
of Aβ in cellular function, as well as its complex effects on cellular and 
organismal physiology that must be considered when using C. elegans as a model 
for Alzheimer's Disease.

AIM: This study aimed to explore differences in the emotions of patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) in group 
rehabilitation using facial analysis.
METHOD: We conducted rehabilitation consisting of aerobic exercise, cognitive 
training, dual tasks (a combination of exercise and cognitive training), and 
creative activities in a group format with patients with MCI and dementia. The 
faces of the 30 patients (MCI: n=14; mild/moderate AD: n=16) who participated 
were filmed from the front with a small camera during the four tasks. Then, we 
used the Kokoro Sensor (CAC Corporation, Japan), a device which estimates 
emotion scores (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) based on 
different parts of the face using artificial intelligence, to calculate emotion 
scores for each activity, and compared them between the MCI and AD groups.
RESULTS: Emotion scores for fear and surprise were significantly higher for the 
AD group than for the MCI group during dual tasks (p=0.016), while emotion 
scores for joy were significantly higher for the MCI group than for the AD group 
during creative activities (p=0.012).
CONCLUSION: Creative activities and dual tasks, which require simultaneous 
physical activity and cognitive thinking, were difficult for patients with AD. 
On the other hand, tasks which used a range of cognitive functions, such as 
creative activities, evoked joy in patients with MCI. It may be beneficial to 
provide tasks and support to patients with respect to their unique emotions 
based on these results.

Digital histology offers a more objective, continuous definition of 
neuropathological severity than traditional staging systems, but its reliability 
remains underexplored. We calculated regional percentage areas occupied by 
phosphorylated tau (p-Tau, AT8), amyloid-β (Aβ, NAB228), and phosphorylated 
α-synuclein (p-αSyn, 81A) pathology in 24 autopsied cases with varying degrees 
of Alzheimer disease neuropathological change and Lewy body disease (LBD) using 
manual and automated immunostaining methods to investigate variability across 
protocols. We then compared natural log-transformed percent area occupied values 
(ln%AO) to blinded ordinal severity scores, Braak stages, Thal phases, and 
McKeith LBD stages. p-Tau ln%AO from methodologically similar runs had the 
highest correlations (R2 = 0.91-0.95, β  =  0.95-0.97 for manual and automated 
methods, respectively); p-αSyn ln%AO from disparate immunostaining methods had 
the lowest (R2 = 0.16-0.34 β  =  0.40-0.59). p-Tau and Aβ ln%AO increased 
regionally with higher Braak and Thal stages (p-Tau: z = 2.06 P = .04. Aβ: 
z = 3.70 P < .001). Regional p-αSyn ln%AO increased from limbic to neocortical 
stages (z = 5.86 P < .001); amygdala-predominant type LBD cases peaked in the 
amygdala and dropped in other limbic regions. These findings show the potential 
to quantify differences in p-Tau, Aβ, and p-αSyn pathologies using digital 
histological methods in single-center studies.

Infectious prions readily adhere to common surfaces, retain infectivity and are 
highly resistant to conventional decontamination, posing significant biosafety 
challenges in the medical and research environments. Recent occupational 
exposures underscore the urgency of improving safety measures. Here, we describe 
an approach combining foam-swab surface sampling and Protein Misfolding Cyclic 
Amplification (PMCA) to enhance prion surveillance. Our results demonstrate the 
ability to detect prions most relevant to human health directly from 
contaminated surfaces, even at 100 million-fold dilutions of the brain. We 
applied our method to assess the completeness of prion decontamination and show 
that high prion quantities can resist even approved inactivation methods. 
Finally, we applied our method in two real-world scenarios including the 
decommissioning and repurposing of a prion research facility and the active 
surveillance of residual prion contamination in an operational laboratory. Our 
methodology offers a robust and efficient tool for detecting residual prion 
contamination, enhancing laboratory safety.

ObjectivesSocial and behavioural symptoms, prevalent across dementia syndromes, 
contribute to increased carer challenges and stress. However, post-diagnostic 
support for these symptoms remains limited. The Carers Way Ahead, initially 
developed for brain injury, is an online carer program addressing behavioural 
management of apathy, irritability, aggression, disinhibition, social 
difficulties, and self-care. This study aimed to explore the experiences and 
needs of family carers and co-design the adaptation of the Carers Way Ahead 
program for dementia.MethodTen family carers of people with dementia (4 
frontotemporal dementia, 3 Alzheimer's disease, 3 Lewy body dementia, 1 Vascular 
dementia) in Australia participated in focus groups and interviews. Carers 
completed the Carers Way Ahead modules and provided insights into their 
experiences and feedback on the program. Transcripts were analysed using 
reflexive thematic analysis.FindingsThree themes were generated: (1) Adapting to 
life transitions highlighted challenges and relationship changes in the dementia 
journey, (2) Navigating dementia care pathways underscored complexities in 
accessing and navigating institutional and practical support, and (3) Finding 
solutions that address carers' needs emphasised the importance of considering 
varying needs across disease stages and pragmatic intervention 
considerations.ConclusionDisparities in the accessibility, consistency, and 
quality of post-diagnostic support for carers were revealed. Substantial unmet 
needs exist in the current post-diagnostic experience for people with dementia 
and carers in Australia. This study suggests opportunities for improvement and 
provides valuable insight for the development and adaptation of psychosocial 
interventions like the Carers Way Ahead program.

The global rise in both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and neurodegenerative diseases 
(NDs), particularly dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a growing health 
and socioeconomic burden. MetS affects approximately 25% of the global adult 
population and is associated with insulin resistance, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and obesity, factors increasingly linked to cognitive impairment 
and brain atrophy. This review explores the shared pathophysiological mechanisms 
between MetS and NDs, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, insulin 
resistance in the brain, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, mitochondrial 
damage, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and alterations in the renin-angiotensin 
system. In terms of substance, MetS patients are four times more likely to 
develop dementia, with increased markers such as CRP and IL-6 present in the 
patient populations. The review suggests the role of astrocytic insulin 
signalling, adipokines, and toll-like receptors as key molecular links. 
Interventions such as caloric restriction, hydroxytyrosol (HT), and intranasal 
insulin have shown promising outcomes at preclinical and early clinical stages. 
Antidiabetic drugs like metformin, liraglutide, and GLP-1 receptor agonists have 
the potential to modulate neuroinflammation and improve cognition. Angiotensin 
receptor blockers like losartan and candesartan also exhibit neuroprotection via 
RAS pathway modulation. The review emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies 
and clinical trials to confirm these therapeutic agents and develop effective 
and cost-friendly interventions for the prevention and management of 
neurodegeneration in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Brain metabolism is reduced in patients with dementia disorders, as demonstrated 
by hypometabolism on 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emissions 
tomography. A contributing factor to the hypometabolism could be decreased 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) leading to a state of subtle hypoperfusion-induced 
tissue hypoxia causing a reduced brain oxygen metabolism and consequently 
elevated brain lactate. In the current exploratory study, we investigated brain 
lactate, global and regional CBF, and global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen 
(CMRO2) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLBs). We hypothesized that the patients demonstrate a state of tissue hypoxia 
with reduced CMRO2 and elevated brain lactate concentration. Participants 
included 24 AD patients, 10 DLB patients, and 15 healthy controls. MR 
spectroscopy measured lactate in the precuneus and occipital lobe. Global CBF 
and venous oxygen saturation (for CMRO2 calculation) were assessed using 
phase-contrast and susceptibility-based oximetry MRI, respectively. Regional CBF 
was measured with ASL-MRI. We observed no significant difference in either brain 
lactate or CMRO2 between groups. The regional CBF in precuneus was significantly 
lower in AD compared to HC; however, this hypoperfusion was not associated with 
a higher lactate concentration. The lack of a difference in CMRO2 or lactate 
concentration between patients and controls suggests that the hypometabolism 
observed in patients with AD and DLB may reflect structural neurodegeneration 
and not a state of tissue hypoxia. The local decrease of CBF in precuneus in 
patients with AD may be due to a lower CBF demand due to neurodegeneration.

This study investigates the potential protective role of annexin A1 (ANXA1) in 
cell models of H2O2-induced Alzheimer's disease. PC12 cells exposed to varying 
concentrations of H2O2 exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. 
H2O2 exposure led to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, reduced 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, and a decline in ANXA1 
protein expression. Under oxidative stress, ANXA1 overexpression increased cell 
viability, reduced apoptosis rate, enhanced the expression of 
microtubule-associated protein 3 (LC3) II/I while reducing phosphorylated 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (p-CAMK2)/CAMK2 and 
phosphorylated beclin 1 (p-BECN1)/BECN1. Conversely, ANXA1 knockdown produced 
contrasting effects. Overexpression of ANXA1, accompanied by administration of 
KN-93 (a competitive inhibitor of CAMK2), can synergistically diminished 
p-CAMK2/CAMK2 and p-BECN1/BECN1 levels while significantly increasing LC3 II/I 
levels, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes. In conclusion, ANXA1 demonstrated a 
protective role in H2O2-induced oxidative stress damage model in PC12 cells by 
inhibiting the CAMK2/BECN1 signaling pathway and enhancing autophagy.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments. Although 
short-term treatment with fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid with 
anti-neuroinflammatory activity, has been reported to prevent cognitive 
impairments in scopolamine- and β-amyloid (Aβ)-treated mice, it remains 
uncertain whether long-term fucoxanthin treatment could produce similar effects 
in transgenic AD models. Moreover, the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism of 
fucoxanthin is still unclear. In this study, long-term treatment with 
fucoxanthin (15-150 mg kg-1, twice a week for 20 weeks) significantly prevented 
cognitive deficits and Aβ-related neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. 
In addition, fucoxanthin largely prevented Aβ oligomer-induced secretion of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of BV2 microglial cells. 
Furthermore, fucoxanthin reduced the increased expression of Nogo-A, a central 
player in AD pathophysiology, as well as the activation of downstream 
Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) 
pathways in AD models. Most importantly, the inhibition of neuroinflammation by 
fucoxanthin was not reduced by shRNA-mediated knockdown of Nogo-A, suggesting 
that fucoxanthin significantly prevented cognitive impairments and 
neuroinflammation via the inhibition of Nogo-A. These results not only elucidate 
an anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism of fucoxanthin, but also provide strong

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) include seven species: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, 
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. The last three, 
classified as Betacoronaviruses, are highly transmissible and have caused severe 
pandemics. HCoV infections primarily affect the respiratory system, leading to 
symptoms such as dry cough, fever, and breath shortness, which can progress to 
acute respiratory failure and death. Beyond respiratory effects, increasing 
evidence links HCoVs to neurological dysfunction. However, distinguishing direct 
neural complications from preexisting disorders, particularly in the elderly, 
remains challenging. This study examines the association between HCoVs and 
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Lewy body 
dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It also 
presents the long-term neurological effects of HCoV infections and their 
differential impact across age groups and sexes. A key aspect of this study is 
the investigation of the sequence and structural similarities between 
amyloidogenic and HCoV spike proteins, which can provide insights into potential 
neuropathomechanisms.

Top-Rated Health Care and Ease of Access to Medications Linked to Lower Medicare 
and ADRD Costs.

University of Maryland, College Park, MD.

IMPORTANCE: Little is known about the extent to which patient self-perception of 
care experience is associated with costs, especially for people with Alzheimer 
disease and related dementias (ADRD).
OBJECTIVE: This study explores the relationship between self-reported quality 
measures and Medicare costs and examines whether the ease of obtaining 
prescribed medications is associated with reduced overall Medicare costs, 
focusing on Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, Medicare 
Beneficiary Summary File data from 2018, 2019, and 2021 were linked to the 
Medicare Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey 
using beneficiary IDs. The study sample included community-dwelling Medicare 
fee-for-service beneficiaries.
EXPOSURES: Five quality measures were used as key exposure variables: (1) 
beneficiary's rating on health care, (2) ease of getting care/tests/treatment 
through the health plan, (3) whether the doctor always explained, listened, 
respected, and spent enough time with the patient, (4) ease of obtaining 
prescribed medications, and (5) whether doctor always talked about all the 
prescription medicines the beneficiary was taking.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Annual total Medicare payments per person.
RESULTS: The study included 230,617 Medicare FFS beneficiaries aged 65 and 
older, including 16,452 beneficiaries with ADRD. Among the total beneficiaries, 
53% were females (vs. 56% of ADRD beneficiaries), with a mean (SD) age of 75.8 
(SD 7.27) years [vs. 82.5 (SD 7.97) years for ADRD beneficiaries]. Fully 
adjusted analyses showed significant negative associations between quality 
measures and total per-capita payments, with more pronounced cost reductions 
among patients with ADRD. Specifically, patients with ADRD who reported it was 
always easy to get care had reductions of $1,922.0 (95% CI, -$3304.8 to 
-$539.2), while those who reported it was always easy to get prescribed 
medications had reductions of $2964.5 (95% CI, -$4518.8 to -$1410.1). In 
addition, beneficiaries who reported that doctors always discussed the medicines 
experienced cost reductions of $2299.7 (95% CI, -$3800.5 to -$799.0) in medicare 
costs.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our findings suggest that high-quality care is not 
necessarily associated with high costs. Meanwhile, focusing on the ease of 
access to needed care, obtaining prescription drugs, and effective communication 
about medication is critical in improving care quality while reducing costs.

A majority of persons living with dementia rely on informal family and friend 
caregivers. These caregivers shoulder immense responsibility while the person 
living with dementia is alive, and during bereavement are at risk for 
complicated grief or other psychobiological complications. Meaning making, the 
process of accommodating worldviews and beliefs to make meaning of a death, can 
mitigate the risk for complications of grief during bereavement. This meaning 
making can be facilitated by storytelling photo-elicitation interventions, which 
invite caregivers to narrate their experiences and emotions using images. 
Caregiver Speaks is one such photo-elicitation intervention. In this study, we 
sought to understand how caregivers of persons living with dementia who 
participated in Caregiver Speaks made meaning of their experiences. Researchers 
conducted a secondary qualitative analysis of text and image social media posts 
made by bereaved caregivers, employing a hybrid deductive-inductive approach. 
Six themes were identified: grieving, remembering, benefit finding, 
reconstructing identity, religious and spiritual coping, and connecting. These 
themes demonstrate that meaning making in caregivers of persons living with 
dementia was supported by Caregiver Speaks and expand on understanding of 
bereavement specific to caregivers of persons living with dementia. Our themes 
emphasize the significance of complete remembrance-of positive memories, but 
also of complex familial relationships and difficulties in caregiving and end of 
life. Additionally, we identified overwhelmingly positive religious coping, 
speaking to the role of faith in this population. Our theme of connecting also 
identified the novel ways in which caregivers might communicate through use of 
images, metaphors, and emojis to convey their emotions. Our findings support the 
use of storytelling, photo-elicitation interventions like Caregiver Speaks to 
prevent or mitigate grief complications in bereaved caregivers of persons living 
with dementia. They also suggest possible complementary interventions in 
bereavement support, such as facilitating remembrance or faith-based community 
outreach.

INTRODUCTION: The EXERT study (Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems) was 
a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that examined effects of 
exercise on cognition and other measures of brain health in sedentary older 
adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Participants were randomized to moderate-high intensity aerobic 
training (AX) or low-intensity stretching/balance/range of motion (SBR) for 
18 months. Exercise was supervised for the first 12 months. Assessments were 
administered at baseline and every 6 months. The primary outcome was a global 
cognitive composite.
RESULTS: A total of 296 participants were enrolled, and intervention adherence 
was high (supervised session attendance: AX = 81%, SBR = 87%). Intervention 
effects on cognition did not differ for AX and SBR (regression = -0.078, 
standard error [SE] = 0.074; p = 0.3). Notably, there was no 12 month  cognition 
decline for either group, and mean 12 month  hippocampal volume loss for both 
groups was low at 0.51%.
DISCUSSION: Exercise intensity did not differentially affect cognitive 
trajectory. Intervention delivery was successful (high adherence) and cognition 
remained stable over 12 months  for both MCI groups, an association that 
warrants further study.
HIGHLIGHTS: Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems (EXERT) was a large 
multisite randomized controlled trial of moderate-high intensity aerobic 
training versus lower-intensity flexibility and balance exercise in sedentary 
older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A sensitive and 
validated measure of global cognitive function, the Alzheimer's Disease 
Assessment Scale-Cognition supplemented with tests of executive function 
(ADAS-Cog-Exec), was used to assess intervention efficacy with 12 months of 
supervised exercise. There was no intervention group difference on the 12-month 
cognitive trajectory of the ADAS-Cog-Exec. Intervention delivery was successful 
(high adherence), and cognition remained stable over 12 months for both exercise 
groups. Regular supported moderate-high or lower-intensity exercise may stall 
decline in adults with amnestic MCI, but further investigation is needed.

INTRODUCTION: EXERT was a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining 
the effects of moderate-high intensity aerobic training (AX) versus 
lower-intensity stretching/balance/range of motion (SBR) on cognitive 
trajectories in older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
METHODS: Preplanned post-hoc analyses were conducted to compare each arm to a 
propensity-matched usual care (no intervention) group from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) selected for similarity across key 
characteristics. Differences in 12-month trajectories in the primary endpoint 
(ADAS-Cog-Exec) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes in prespecified 
brain regions were compared.
RESULTS: AX and SBR showed significantly less 12-month cognitive decline than 
ADNI-1 (AX:n = 109, β = 0.169, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.011-0.328; 
SBR:n = 105, β = 0.181, 95% CI 0.007-0.354). There were trends of less 
prefrontal cortex volume loss for both EXERT groups and less AD signature region 
volume loss for SBR relative to ADNI-1 over 12 months.
DISCUSSION: Moderate-high intensity aerobic or low-intensity flexibility 
exercise for 12 months in participants with aMCI may provide protection against 
decline relative to usual care.
CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The EXERT clinical trial is registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02814526).
HIGHLIGHTS: EXERT was a randomized controlled trial in sedentary older adults 
with aMCI. EXERT arms were propensity-matched to a usual care (no intervention) 
group (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 [ADNI-1]). High and 
low-intensity exercise arms had less 12-mo cognitive decline than ADNI-1. There 
were trends of less prefrontal cortex volume loss for each arm versus ADNI-1.

Bereaved dementia caregivers face unique challenges in navigating grief, yet 
research on dementia-specific adaptive grieving remains limited. Expanding on a 
prior scoping review, this concept analysis clarifies the theoretical construct 
of adaptive grief among bereaved dementia caregivers using Rodgers' evolutionary 
approach, which views concepts as dynamic and evolving. A review of 11 data 
sources (2013-2024) across nursing, sociology, medicine, and psychology 
identified three key attributes of dementia-specific adaptive grief: (1) 
rebuilding purpose: reconnecting with interests and community on one's own 
terms, (2) integrating change: blending past, present, and future experiences to 
regain direction, and (3) growing toward potential: pursuing self-defined goals 
and personal development. By defining dementia-specific adaptive grief, this 
concept analysis provides healthcare professionals with a clearer framework to 
recognize its evolving nature and distinguish it from maladaptive grief. It also 
emphasizes the need for longitudinal and culturally diverse research to inform 
tailored interventions that better support bereaved dementia caregivers.

OBJECTIVES: Adult child caregivers of older adults living with Alzheimer's 
disease and related dementias are at risk of burnout due to competing caregiving 
demands from multiple generations. Yet, drawing from structural family theory, 
this study aims to examine the extent to which family dynamics, especially 
greater family cohesion and less family conflict, are associated with children's 
mental and physical health.
METHOD: The present study was secondary data analysis of an observational study, 
in which 150 pairs of adult-child caregivers and parents with early-stage 
cognitive impairment self-reported their health, family relationships (cohesion, 
expressiveness, and conflict), and family conflict regarding caregiving.
RESULTS: Findings indicate that family cohesion and expressiveness are 
significantly positively, and family conflict is significantly negatively, 
associated with children's mental health. However, we did not find any 
significant association with physical health.
CONCLUSION: Supportive family relationships may buffer the mental health of 
adult-child caregivers whose parents are living with early-stage cognitive 
impairment. Tailored interventions focusing on family relationships and 
conflicts are crucial to support children in managing the challenges associated 
with caregiving.

INTRODUCTION: Imaging biomarkers are fundamental in diagnosing neurodegenerative 
diseases, but their use in FTD remains limited. This study examines PET 
biomarkers in Argentine bvFTD patients.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of bvFTD patients (n = 20) and controls (n = 21) 
with three different PET radiotracers (18F-FDG, 11C-PiB, and 18F-AV1451).
RESULTS: In bvFTD patients, 18F-FDG PET showed significant hypometabolism in 
frontotemporal regions, along with hypermetabolism in the precentral gyrus, 
compared to normal controls. 11C-PIB did not reveal a pattern typical of 
Alzheimer's disease, yet increased uptake was notably observed in the precentral 
region. We found 18F-AV1451 uptake in frontal lobe, parietal, precuneus, cuneus, 
posterior cingulum, highly significant in bvFTD with respect to NCs.
DISCUSSION: PET biomarkers are a crucial tool in diverse real-world clinical 
scenarios. However, their utility in revealing questions about the underlying 
pathology in FTD is still limited.
HIGHLIGHTS: First bvFTD study using 18F-FDG, 11C-PIB, and 18F-AV1451 PET in a 
Latin American cohort. Frontotemporal hypometabolism with compensatory 
precentral hypermetabolism due to amyloid. Amyloid deposits observed in the 
precentral gyrus without an Alzheimer's-like pattern. 18F-AV1451 shows 
limitations in specificity for bvFTD pathology. Study provides new insights into 
PET biomarker utility for bvFTD clinical assessment.

INTRODUCTION: This study investigates whether midlife cortisol levels predict 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker burden 15 years later, with particular 
attention to sex differences and menopausal status.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 305 cognitively unimpaired Framingham Heart Study 
participants (48.5% female; mean age: 39.6 ± 8.1 years). Serum cortisol was 
categorized into tertiles, with amyloid ([11C]PiB) and tau ([18F]Flortaucipir) 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging conducted 15 years later. We 
performed multivariable regression analyses adjusted for confounders including, 
apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status.
RESULTS: Elevated midlife cortisol correlated with increased amyloid deposition, 
specifically in post-menopausal women, predominantly in posterior cingulate, 
precuneus, and frontal-lateral regions (p < 0.05). No significant associations 
were observed with tau burden or in males.
DISCUSSION: These findings reveal post-menopausal women with high midlife 
cortisol are at increased risk of AD. Results highlight the importance of 
identifying early risk factors when biomarkers are detectable but cognitive 
impairment is absent.
HIGHLIGHTS: High midlife cortisol is linked to increased amyloid deposition in 
post-menopausal women. Cortisol showed no association with tau pathology. 
Post-menopausal hormone changes may amplify cortisol's effects on amyloid.

INTRODUCTION: Older adults from minoritized and socioeconomically 
disadvantaged backgrounds commonly receive health care in safety net health 
settings and may be at high risk of dementia. We assessed the prevalence of 
diagnosed dementia in a large safety net health system.
METHODS: International Classification of Disease 10th Revision codes were used 
to classify presence of dementia for 147,689 older adults with at least one 
ambulatory encounter in 2019 using electronic health record data. Prevalence was 
calculated for the sample overall and by age cohort, sex, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Diagnosed dementia prevalence was 0.3% for adults 50 to 64 and 3.0% for 
adults aged ≥ 65. Adults with diagnosed dementia were older, less likely to 
speak English, and had more medical comorbidities and higher health-care use 
than those without.
DISCUSSION: This study's estimates of dementia prevalence were considerably 
lower than other samples, which may be due to incomplete coding or to 
underdiagnosis of dementia in a safety net setting.
HIGHLIGHTS: Six percent to 10% of older adults do not have Medicare and often 
receive health care in safety net health systems; however, little information 
exists about dementia care in this practice setting. The Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services is the nation's second largest municipal health 
system and provides ambulatory care to > 30,000 older adults annually, of whom > 
85% are from minoritized populations and 60% of whom do not have Medicare. We 
used International Classification of Disease 10th Revision codes and demographic 
and clinical information derived from the electronic health record to estimate 
age-adjusted prevalence of dementia in this safety net health setting. 
Prevalence of diagnosed dementia was significantly less than expected based on 
national samples, likely reflecting significant underdiagnosis and/or 
undercoding of dementia in this practice setting.

Extracellular β-amyloid protein (Aβ) plaques are prominent pathological feature 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ oligomers and plaques induce sustained 
microglial activation via the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/interferon regulatory factor 5 
(IRF5) signaling pathway. This microglial activation-mediated neuroinflammation 
can accelerate neuronal cell senescence. Consequently, the regulation of the 
AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 pathway presents a potential therapeutic target for AD, as it may 
inhibit neuroinflammation and delay neuronal cell senescence. Mangiferin, a 
bioactive natural polyphenol extracted from the leaves of Mangifera indica 
Linn., has garnered significant attention for its anti-inflammatory properties. 
However, it remains unclear whether mangiferin can modulate the AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 
pathway to inhibit microglial activation-mediated neuroinflammation and delay 
neuronal cell senescence. This study employed both cellular and animal models of 
neuronal cell senescence to explore the effects of mangiferin on the regulation 
of the AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 pathway, aiming to inhibit neuroinflammation and delay 
neuronal cell senescence in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cells were subjected to a neuroinflammatory microenvironment 
induced by Aβ1-42-mediated HMC3 microglial activation to induce neuronal cell 
senescence in vitro. Additionally, SAMP8 accelerated aging mice were utilized as 
an aging animal model. The results indicate that mangiferin significantly 
enhances AMPK phosphorylation in microglial cells, inhibits mTOR activation, and 
downregulates IRF5 expression. These effects collectively suppress microglial 
activation and markedly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by 
activated microglia. Consequently, there is a decrease in the proportion of 
neurons arrested in the G0/G1 phase and a reduction in the number of 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) positive neurons. Furthermore, 
mangiferin significantly decreases the expression of neuronal cell senescence 
markers P16Ink4a and P21Cip1. Collectively, these findings suggest that 
mangiferin effectively regulates the AMPK/mTOR/IRF5 pathway, inhibits 
neuroinflammation mediated by microglial activation, and delays neuronal cell 
senescence. This study underscores the potential of mangiferin for the treatment 
of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is known to have a potential impact on cognitive function 
and mental health. This study aims to assess the association between dietary 
vitamin D intake and cognitive performance, as well as depression, in an elderly 
U.S. population.
METHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
2013-2014 were analyzed. A total of 1,344 elderly participants were categorized 
into three tertiles based on their dietary vitamin D intake (D2 + D3). Cognitive 
function was measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for 
Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and 
Animal Fluency Test, while depression was assessed through the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Adjustments were made for confounding variables, 
including age, sex, race, education, physical activity level, and other dietary 
factors.
RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, individuals in the 3rd tertile of 
vitamin D intake (≥4.9 mcg/day) had significantly reduced odds of low 
performance on the CERAD test (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.57-0.98; p = 0.031) and 
Animal Fluency test (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.49-0.85; p = 0.013) compared to the 1st 
tertile of intake (≤2.4 mcg/day). Similarly, participants in the 3rd tertile of 
vitamin D intake had lower odds of depression (PHQ-9 score > 4) after adjustment 
(OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.99; p = 0.046).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that dietary vitamin D intake is associated 
with improved cognitive function and depressive symptoms in elderly individuals. 
However, further longitudinal studies are needed to establish causality and 
explore the underlying mechanisms.

Over the years, the global disease burden of neurological disorders (NDs) and 
mental disorders (MDs) has significantly increased, making them one of the most 
critical concerns and challenges to human health. In pursuit of novel therapies 
against MD and ND, there has been a growing focus on nutrition and health. 
Dietary sulfur, primarily derived from various natural sources, plays a crucial 
role in numerous physiological processes, including brain function. This review 
offers an overview of the chemical composition of several natural sources of the 
sulfur-rich substances such as isothiocyanates, sulforaphane, glutathione, 
taurine, sulfated polysaccharides, allyl sulfides, and sulfur-containing amino 
acids, all of which have neuroprotective properties. A multitude of studies have 
documented that consuming foods that are high in sulfur enhances brain function 
by improving cognitive parameters and reduces the severity of neuropathology by 
exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties at the molecular level. 
In addition, the growing role of natural sulfur compounds in repairing 
endothelial dysfunction, compromising blood-brain barrier and improving cerebral 
blood flow, are documented here. Furthermore, this review covers the encouraging 
results of supplementing sulfur-rich diets in many animal models and clinical 
investigations, along with their molecular targets in MD, such as schizophrenia, 
depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, and ND, 
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The prospects of natural sulfur 
compounds show great promise as they have potential applications in 
nutraceuticals, medicines, and functional foods to enhance brain function and 
prevent diseases. However, additional research is required to clarify the 
mechanisms by which it works, enhance its bioavailability, and evaluate its 
long-term safety for broad use.

Clinical Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Long-term adherence to the Mediterranean Diet has been shown 
to improve cognitive function in patients. However, there is a lack of evidence 
regarding the impact of the Mediterranean diet and cognitive impairment on 
long-term mortality outcomes. This study aims to explore whether there is an 
interaction between the degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet and 
cognitive impairment on long-term mortality outcomes.
METHODS: The study included 2,520 participants from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2011 and 2014. The 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the 9-point alternative 
Mediterranean diet index (aMED index). Cognitive function was assessed using the 
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD), the Animal 
Fluency Test (AFT), and the Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). By 
accessing public records from the National Death Index (NDI), NHANES 
participants' information was linked to death certificate records to determine 
mortality and causes of death during the follow-up period, up to December 31, 
2019, with causes specified according to ICD-10. Participants were categorized 
based on the median aMED score into low adherence (scores 0-3), moderate 
adherence (score 4), and high adherence (scores 5-9) groups. Cognitive 
impairment was assessed by calculating the arithmetic mean of standardized 
scores (Z-scores) for each cognitive test. Participants with scores below the 
first quartile of the arithmetic mean were considered to have cognitive 
impairment. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the 
relationship between cognitive impairment, aMED, and all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality outcomes. Additionally, the interaction between 
cognitive impairment and aMED on these outcomes was evaluated.
RESULTS: The study included 2,520 participants, with 481 deaths during the 
follow-up period, of which 129 (26.8%) were cardiovascular-related. The median 
aMED score in the population was 4, and 632 individuals (25.1%) were considered 
to have cognitive impairment. A higher aMED score was associated with a reduced 
risk of long-term all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality (HR, 
0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.81, p < 0.001; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91, p = 0.039). 
Cognitive impairment was associated with an increased risk of long-term 
all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.46-2.18, 
p < 0.001; HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.22-2.64, p = 0.003). Individuals with both lower 
aMED scores and cognitive impairment had higher risks of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality. Subgroup analysis indicates that only in the cognitive 
impairment subgroup is a higher Mediterranean diet score associated with a 
reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality. There is an interaction between lower 
aMED scores and cognitive impairment in increasing cardiovascular-related 
mortality (p for interaction = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: There is an interaction between adherence to the Mediterranean diet 
and cognitive impairment concerning cardiovascular-related mortality, but not 
all-cause mortality. Among individuals with cognitive impairment, adherence to 
the Mediterranean diet has a more significant impact on cardiovascular-related 
mortality.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly reduces the quality of life of patients 
and exacerbates the burden on their families and society. Resistance exercise 
significantly enhances the overall cognitive function of the elderly and 
patients with AD while positively improving memory, executive function, and 
muscle strength, reducing fall risks, and alleviating psychological symptoms. As 
AD is a neurodegenerative disorder, some nerve factors are readily activated and 
released during exercise. Therefore, several prior studies have concentrated on 
exploring the molecular mechanisms of resistance exercise and their impact on 
brain function and neural plasticity. Recent investigations have identified an 
intrinsic relationship between individuals with AD and the pathological 
mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy, establishing a correlation between 
patients with AD cognitive level and skeletal muscle content. Resistance 
exercise primarily targets the skeletal muscle, which improves cognitive 
impairment in patients with AD by reducing vascular and neuroinflammatory 
factors and further enhances cognitive function in patients with AD by restoring 
the structural function of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the effects of 
resistance training vary among distinct subgroups of cognitive impairment. 
Individuals exhibiting lower cognitive function demonstrate more pronounced 
adaptive responses in physical performance over time. Consequently, further 
investigation is warranted to determine whether tailored guidelines-such as 
variations in the frequency and duration of resistance exercise-should be 
established for patients with varying levels of dementia, in order to optimize 
the benefits for those experiencing cognitive impairment. This study aimed to 
review the relationship between AD and skeletal muscle atrophy, the impact of 
skeletal muscle atrophy on AD cognition, the mechanism by which resistance 
exercise improves cognition through skeletal muscle improvement, and the optimal 
resistance exercise mode to elucidate the additional advantages of resistance 
exercise in treating cognitive function in patients with AD and skeletal muscle 
atrophy.

Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the progressive degeneration of neurons 
and/or their myelin sheaths, ultimately leading to cognitive and motor 
dysfunction. Due to their complex pathogenesis and the limited efficacy of 
therapeutic drugs, these diseases have attracted significant attention. 
Achyranthes aspera, belongs to family Amaranthaceae, has been extensively used 
in the traditional and folk medicines for the treatment of various ailments. 
Modern research has revealed that Achyranthes aspera possesses various 
pharmacological effects, including cardiocerebrovascular protection, immune 
regulation, antioxidation, and anti-aging. Furthermore, the neuroprotective 
effects of Achyranthes aspera have been confirmed by numerous scientific 
studies. This review focuses on the primary pharmacological effects and 
mechanisms of Achyranthes aspera in the prevention and treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases, as well as their potential application prospects. 
This review aims to provide insights into the potential clinical applications 
and research directions of Achyranthes aspera in neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline; recent studies suggest that neuronal 
ferroptosis plays a key role in its pathogenesis. Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a 
traditional Chinese medicine formula, has shown demonstrated neuroprotective 
effects, but its precise mechanisms in AD treatment remain unclear. This study 
aims to investigate the mechanism of DSS in treating AD by inhibiting neuronal 
ferroptosis, explore whether DSS alleviates AD by suppressing neuronal 
ferroptosis via the AMPK/Sp1/ACSL4 pathway.
METHODS: Chemical composition of DSS was identified by LC-MS/MS, followed by 
network pharmacology to predict targets and pathways. Molecular docking assessed 
binding affinities between DSS compounds and key proteins (AMPK, Sp1, ACSL4). In 
vivo experiments on APP/PS1 mice evaluated DSS effects on cognitive function, 
oxidative stress markers, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis-related proteins.
RESULTS: Network pharmacology analysis suggested that DSS regulates lipid 
metabolism and inhibits neuronal ferroptosis via the AMPK pathway. Molecular 
docking revealed strong binding affinities between DSS compounds and AMPK 
downstream proteins, Sp1 and ACSL4. In vivo experiments showed that DSS improved 
cognitive function, enhanced antioxidant capacity, reduced lipid peroxide 
accumulation, and decreased Fe2+ content in brain tissue. Furthermore, DSS 
increased the expression of FTH, p-AMPK, and GPX4 while decreasing Sp1 and ACSL4 
levels, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis.
CONCLUSION: DSS alleviates AD symptoms by suppressing neuronal ferroptosis via 
the AMPK/Sp1/ACSL4 axis, representing a novel lipid metabolism-targeted 
therapeutic strategy.

Diagnostic performance of Alzheimer's disease blood biomarkers in a Brazilian 
cohort.

Blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) have emerged as promising tools to enhance 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Despite two-thirds of dementia cases 
occurring in the Global South, research on BBMs has predominantly focused on 
populations from the Global North. This geographical disparity hinders our 
understanding of BBM performance in diverse populations. To address this, we 
evaluated the diagnostic properties of AD BBMs in a real-world memory clinic 
from Brazil, one of the largest countries in the Global South. We measured blood 
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers - amyloid-β (Aβ)40, Aβ42, 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217, neurofilament light (NfL) chain, and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) - in 59 individuals. Sample comprised 20 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, 22 with AD dementia, and 17 with 
vascular dementia (VaD). We compared BBM levels across diagnostic groups and 
assessed their discriminative ability for AD. Notably, individuals with VaD and 
AD had lower educational levels (6.8±3.0) compared to CU individuals (61.4±6.6). 
Among the BBMs tested, plasma p-tau217 demonstrated the best performance, 
exhibiting high accuracy in differentiating CU from AD (AUC 0.96) and Aβ 
pathology (AUC 0.98). However, the ability of AD BBMs to distinguish between AD 
and VaD was lower than expected (AUC from 0.52 to 0.79), particularly when 
compared to studies from the Global North. Our findings highlight the potential 
utility of BBMs for AD diagnosis in real-world settings within the Global South. 
However, they also underscore the need for proper implementation and validation 
of these biomarkers within these populations to ensure accurate and reliable 
results.

BACKGROUND: The burden of neurological diseases in women is underestimated. This 
study aimed to estimate the pattern and trend of four major nervous system 
diseases in women.
METHODS: Utilizing data from the GBD Study 2021 on the incidence and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other 
dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and idiopathic epilepsy in 
women from 1990 to 2021. We estimated trends by age and socio-demographic index 
(SDI), globally, regionally, and nationally, using Estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPC), Spearman correlation analysis and projected future trends with 
the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model.
RESULTS: In 2021, an estimated 6191564.2, 572999.9, 1536118.7, and 39191.7 new 
cases of female AD and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, 
and idiopathic epilepsy were reported globally, with a significant increase in 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) from 1990 to 2021. Contrary, the 
age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) decreased in idiopathic epilepsy and multiple 
sclerosis. AD and other dementias and Parkinson's disease were prevalent among 
women worldwide, followed by idiopathic epilepsy and multiple sclerosis, with 
regional and country disparities. There are also difference of patterns among 
age and SDI. The BAPC model projects that by 2050, the ASIR of the four major 
neurological disorders will continue to increase.
CONCLUSION: The burden of major neurological diseases in women is a serious 
global health challenge. Given the regional disparities and varying age patterns 
in incidence and DALYs, there is an urgent need for tailored prevention and 
healthcare approaches to mitigate the burden worldwide.

BACKGROUND: While education is crucial for brain health, evidence mainly relies 
on individual measures of years of education (YoE), neglecting education quality 
(EQ). The effect of YoE and EQ on aging and dementia has not been compared.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of the effect of EQ and YoE 
on brain health in 7533 subjects from 20 countries, including healthy controls 
(HCs), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). 
EQ was based on country-level quality indicators provided by the programme for 
international student assessment (PISA). After applying neuroimage 
harmonization, we examined its effect, along with YoE, on gray matter volume and 
functional connectivity. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and 
cognition, controlling for multiple comparisons. The influence of image quality 
was assessed through sensitivity analysis. Data collection was conducted between 
June 1 and October 30, 2024.
FINDINGS: Less EQ and YoE were associated with brain alterations across groups. 
However, EQ had a stronger influence, mainly targeting the critical areas of 
each condition. At the whole-brain level, EQ influenced volume (HCs: Δmean = 2·0 
[1·9-2·0] × 10-2, p < 10-5; AD: Δmean = 0·1 [-0·0 to 0·3] × 10-2, p = 0·18; 
FTLD: Δmean = 3·5 [3·0-4·0] × 10-2, p < 10-5; all with 95% confidence intervals) 
and networks (HCs: Δmean = 13·5 [13·2-13·7] × 10-2, p < 10-5; AD: Δmean = 5·9 
[5·2-6·7] × 10-2, p < 10-5; FTLD: Δmean = 13·2 [11·2-13·7] × 10-2, p < 10-5) 1·3 
to 7·0 times more than YoE. These effects remain robust despite variations in 
income and socioeconomic factors at country and individual levels.
INTERPRETATION: The results support the need to incorporate education quality 
into studying and improving brain health, underscoring the importance of 
country-level measures.

Lewy body dementia is associated with abnormal eosinophilic A-synuclein neural 
inclusions (Lewy bodies) in the brain. It is a neurodegenerative illness-and the 
second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease-that causes memory 
loss and severe problems in carrying out daily activities. In this report, we 
describe a case of Lewy body dementia that began with early psychotic symptoms 
with atypical features (transition from hallucinosis (hallucinatory insight) to 
true visual hallucinations) -without Parkinsonism. The patient exhibited 
sensitivity to first generation antipsychotic medication, which led to a 
worsening of her symptoms. Physicians should consider all possible diagnoses 
when confronted with atypical, early symptoms of visual hallucinosis or true 
hallucinations and dementia without Parkinsonism. Choosing antipsychotic 
medicines should be made with care given these patients' possible sensitivity to 
antipsychotics. The selection of antipsychotics should be consider among first, 
second and third generation options.

Introduction: Transcriptional regulation is an important process wherein 
non-protein coding enhancer sequences play a key role in determining cell type 
identity and phenotypic diversity. In neural tissue, these gene regulatory 
processes are crucial for coordinating a plethora of interconnected and 
regionally specialized cell types, ensuring their synchronized activity in 
generating behavior. Recognizing the intricate interplay of gene regulatory 
processes in the brain is imperative, as mounting evidence links 
neurodevelopment and neurological disorders to non-coding genome regions. While 
genome-wide association studies are swiftly identifying non-coding human 
disease-associated loci, decoding regulatory mechanisms is challenging due to 
causal variant ambiguity and their specific tissue impacts. Methods: Massively 
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are widely used in cell culture to study the 
non-coding enhancer regions, linking genome sequence differences to 
tissue-specific regulatory function. However, widespread use in animals 
encounters significant challenges, including insufficient viral library delivery 
and library quantification, irregular viral transduction rates, and injection 
site inflammation disrupting gene expression. Here, we introduce a systemic MPRA 
(sysMPRA) to address these challenges through systemic intravenous AAV viral 
delivery. Results: We demonstrate successful transduction of the MPRA library 
into diverse mouse tissues, efficiently identifying tissue specificity in 
candidate enhancers and aligning well with predictions from machine learning 
models. We highlight that sysMPRA effectively uncovers regulatory effects 
stemming from the disruption of MEF2C transcription factor binding sites, 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and the consequences of genetic variations 
associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: SysMPRA is an 
effective library delivering method that simultaneously determines the 
transcriptional functions of hundreds of enhancers in vivo across multiple 
tissues.

The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in human life and undergoes dynamic 
changes throughout the human lifespan, from infancy to old age. During our life, 
the gut microbiota influences health and disease across life stages. This review 
summarizes the discussions and presentations from the symposium "Gut microbiota 
development from infancy to old age" held in collaboration with the Journal of 
Internal Medicine. In early infancy, microbial colonization is shaped by factors 
such as mode of delivery, antibiotic exposure, and milk-feeding practices, 
laying the foundation for subsequent increased microbial diversity and 
maturation. Throughout childhood and adolescence, microbial maturation 
continues, influencing immune development and metabolic health. In adulthood, 
the gut microbiota reaches a relatively stable state, influenced by genetics, 
diet, and lifestyle. Notably, disruptions in gut microbiota composition have 
been implicated in various inflammatory diseases-including inflammatory bowel 
disease, Type 1 diabetes, and allergies. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests 
a connection between gut dysbiosis and neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the role of the gut microbiota in disease 
pathogenesis across life stages provides insights into potential therapeutic 
interventions. Probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications, as well as 
fecal microbiota transplantation, are being explored as promising strategies to 
promote a healthy gut microbiota and mitigate disease risks. This review focuses 
on the gut microbiota's role in infancy, adulthood, and aging, addressing its 
development, stability, and alterations linked to health and disease across 
these critical life stages. It outlines future research directions aimed at 
optimizing the gut microbiota composition to improve health.

Brain atrophy over time, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has 
been shown to predict subsequent cognitive impairment among individuals who were 
cognitively normal when first evaluated, indicating that subtle brain atrophy 
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may begin years before clinical 
symptoms appear. Traditionally, atrophy has been quantified by differences in 
brain volume or thickness over a specified timeframe. Research indicates that 
the rate of atrophy varies across different brain regions, which themselves 
exhibit complex spatial and hierarchical organizations. These characteristics 
collectively emphasize the need for diverse summary measures that can 
effectively capture the multidimensional nature of degeneration. In this study, 
we explore the use of distance measurements to quantify brain volumetric changes 
using processed MRI data from the Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Consortium 
(PAC). We conducted a series of analyses to predict future diagnostic status by 
modeling MRI trajectories for participants who were cognitively normal at 
baseline and either remained cognitively normal or progressed to mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) over time, with adjustments for age, sex, education, and APOE 
genotype. We consider multiple distance measures and brain regions through a 
two-step approach. First, we build base models by fitting individual 
mixed-effect models for each distance metric and brain region pairing, using 
follow-up diagnosis (normal vs. MCI) as the outcome and volumetric changes from 
the baseline, as summarized by a given distance measure, as predictors. The 
second step aggregates these individual region-distance base models to derive an 
overall estimate of diagnostic status. Our analyses showed that the distance 
measures approach consistently outperformed the traditional direct volumetric 
approach in terms of predictive accuracy, both in individual base models and the 
aggregated models. This work highlights the potential advantage of using 
distance measures over the traditional direct volumetric approach to capture the 
multidimensional aspects of atrophy in the development of AD and related 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is a key feature of cerebral small 
vessel disease (CSVD). The impact of the choroid plexus (CP) volume on disease 
progression remains largely unexplored. This study evaluated the relationship 
between CP volume and CSVD severity via WMH volume and susceptibility values. 
Additionally, we explored whether Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related plasma 
proteins influence the volume of the CP.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our study included 291 CSVD individuals, with 84 
participants completing subsequent brain MRI at a mean follow-up of 20 months. 
To explore the potential CP-associated pathways, we assessed the relationships 
between AD-related plasma biomarkers and CP volume via multiple linear 
regression analysis. The longitudinal associations between CP volume and WMH 
characteristics (WMH volume and susceptibility) were analyzed via linear 
mixed-effects models. Finally, we employed random forest analysis with the 
Boruta algorithm to identify key predictors of CSVD severity.
RESULTS: Plasma Aβ1‒40 levels were positively correlated with CP volume 
(β = 0.115, P = 0.009), whereas Aβ42‒40 ratio were negatively associated with CP 
volume (β = -0.135, P = 0.03). Notably, increased CP volume was associated with 
both greater WMH burden (β = 0.191, P = 0.011) and decreased WMH susceptibility 
(β = -0.192, P = 0.012). Furthermore, random forest modeling identified CP 
volume and WMH susceptibility as the strongest predictors of CSVD severity.
CONCLUSIONS: CP volume changes were significantly correlated with both WMH 
volume and WMH susceptibility in CSVD patients. These findings suggest that 
CP-mediated pathways may link amyloid metabolism to CSVD progression.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in Transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) is known 
to influence the risk and presentation in several neurodegenerative diseases and 
modifies healthy aging. While evidence from human studies suggests that the risk 
allele is associated with higher levels of TMEM106B, the contribution of 
elevated levels of TMEM106B to neurodegeneration and aging has not been assessed 
and it remains unclear how TMEM106B modulates disease risk.
METHODS: To study the effect of increased TMEM106B levels, we generated 
Cre-inducible transgenic mice expressing human wild-type TMEM106B. We evaluated 
lysosomal and neuronal health using in vitro and in vivo assays including 
transmission electron microscopy, immunostainings, behavioral testing, 
electrophysiology, and bulk RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: We created the first transgenic mouse model that successfully 
overexpresses TMEM106B, with a 4- to 8-fold increase in TMEM106B protein levels 
in heterozygous (hTMEM106B(+)) and homozygous (hTMEM106B(++)) animals, 
respectively. We showed that the increase in TMEM106B protein levels induced 
lysosomal dysfunction and age-related downregulation of genes associated with 
neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. Increased TMEM106B levels led to 
altered synaptic signaling in 12-month-old animals which further exhibited an 
anxiety-like phenotype. Finally, we observed mild neuronal loss in the 
hippocampus of 21-month-old animals.
CONCLUSION: Characterization of the first transgenic mouse model that 
overexpresses TMEM106B suggests that higher levels of TMEM106B negatively 
impacts brain health by modifying brain aging and impairing the resilience of 
the brain to the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders. This novel 
model will be a valuable tool to study the involvement and contribution of 
increased TMEM106B levels to aging and will be essential to study the many 
age-related diseases in which TMEM106B was genetically shown to be a disease- 
and risk-modifier.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer Disease (AD) represents a growing global health concern 
with profound socioeconomic implications, with predictions indicating a 
potential 50% increase in AD cases in Italy over the next 30 years. Timely 
diagnosis remains challenging due to the slow progression of symptoms and 
limited accessibility to advanced diagnostic tools, yet it remains one of the 
few tools available to prevent and alter the clinical course of the disease. The 
aim of this study is to build a cost-of-illness model to estimate the number of 
AD patients managed by the National Health Service, analyzing their use of 
hospital care, and estimating the social costs through real-world data.
METHODS: The analysis encompassed a multifaceted approach, combining real-world 
data analysis from different sources for the period 2014-2019. Health direct 
costs related to AD in Italy were estimated thanks to the Italian database of 
all hospital discharges and a Local Health Unit database (400,000 residents) 
collecting all information on resource consumption related to AD. The National 
Social Security System database was used to estimate social security costs 
(disability compensations) related to Attendance Allowance (AA) recognitions.
RESULTS: In Italy a prevalence of 413,715 AD patients was estimated, with annual 
health direct costs per patient equal to €3,779. Annual social security costs 
related to AA recognitions amounted to 240 million euros. Overall, the analysis 
estimated an annual total cost exceeding 1.8 billion euros.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted 
burden of AD in Italy, shedding light on its economic dimensions. The results 
underscore the urgency of prioritizing AD on political agendas, especially in 
the face of the projected global surge in AD cases. The study advocates for 
proactive policy interventions and informed healthcare decision-making to 
address the complex challenges posed by AD.

Lewy body dementia (LBD) encompasses neurodegenerative dementias characterized 
by cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Clinical 
differentiation of LBD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains complex due to 
symptom overlap, yet approximately 25% of dementia cases are diagnosed as LBD 
postmortem, primarily identified by the presence of α-synuclein aggregates, tau 
tangles, and amyloid plaques. These pathological features position LBD as a 
comorbid condition of both Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD, with over 50% of LBD 
cases exhibiting co-pathologies. LBD's mixed pathology complicates the 
development of comprehensive models that reflect the full spectrum of LBD's 
etiological, clinical, and pathological features. While existing animal and 
cellular models have facilitated significant discoveries in PD and AD research, 
they lack specificity in capturing LBD's unique pathogenic mechanisms, limiting 
the exploration of therapeutic avenues for LBD specifically. This review 
assesses widely used PD and AD models in terms of their relevance to LBD, 
particularly focusing on their ability to replicate human disease pathology and 
assess treatment efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss potential modifications to 
these models to advance the understanding of LBD mechanisms and propose 
innovative research directions aimed at developing models with enhanced 
etiological, face, predictive, and construct validity.

BACKGROUD: Numerous evidence from observational studies indicated an association 
between allergic diseases and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the causal 
association of this relationship remains unclear. To address this, we conducted 
a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate 
the potential causal impact of allergic diseases on AD.
METHODS: We used summary statistics for allergic diseases (allergic rhinitis, 
asthma, and atopic dermatitis) and AD from comprehensive genome-wide association 
studies (GWASs). Our primary analytical approach was inverse variance weighted 
(IVW) method, complemented by MR-Egger method and weighted median (WM) method.
RESULTS: In the forward MR analysis, our results indicate that age of onset of 
asthma is a protective factor against AD (OR = 0.824, 95% CI: 0.736-0.922, 
P < 0.001). However, we found no causal link between the age of onset of 
childhood onset asthma (OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 0.955-1.095, P = 0.510), allergic 
rhinitis (OR = 0.609, 95% CI: 0.188-1.973, P = 0.408) or atopic dermatitis 
(OR = 1.000, 95% CI: 0.995-1.005, P = 0.902) and AD risk. The sensitivity 
analysis confirms the robustness of our findings. In the reverse MR analysis, 
our results suggest that asthma has a bidirectional association with AD 
(OR = 0.994, 95% CI: 0.990-0.997, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that age of onset of asthma may reduce genetic 
susceptibility to AD. In addition, AD appear more likely to develop asthma risk. 
However, no significant genetic correlations were observed between allergic 
rhinitis or atopic dermatitis with AD risk.

Decreased expression of sirtuin 1 (SirT1) has been implicated in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and as we previously reported, is related to transcriptional 
repression by the major risk factor for sporadic AD, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4). 
Herein we describe the discovery of an orally brain-permeable small-molecule, 
DDL-218, that enhanced SirT1 in ApoE4-expressing neuronal cells and a murine AD 
model. DDL-218 increased the transcription factor NFYb resulting in upregulation 
of PRMT5. Mechanistic and modeling studies show that binding of ApoE4 to the 
SirT1 gene promoter can be displaced by PRMT5 leading to increased SirT1 
transcription. DDL-218 treatment elicited improvement in memory in the AD model, 
suggesting that DDL-218 enhancement of neurotrophic SirT1 in the brain has 
potential to modulate neuronal activity that may clinically provide an 
improvement in cognitive function and complement the current anti-Aβ antibody 
monotherapy. Our findings support further development of DDL-218 as a novel 
ApoE4-targeted therapeutic candidate for AD.

Dementia includes a variety of neurodegenerative diseases that affect and target 
the brain's fundamental cognitive functions. It is undoubtedly one of the 
diseases that affects people globally. The ameliorating the disease is still not 
known; the symptoms, however, can be prevented to an extent. Dementia 
encompasses Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Lewy 
body dementia, mixed dementia, and various other diseases. The aggregation of 
β-amyloid protein plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles have been 
concluded as the foremost cause for the onset of the disease. As the cases 
climb, new neuroprotective methods are being developed in the form of new drug 
delivery systems that provide targeted delivery. Herbal drugs like Ashwagandha, 
Brahmi, and Cannabis have shown satisfactory results by not only treating the 
symptoms but have also been shown to reduce and ameliorate the formation of 
amyloid plaque formation. This article explores the intricate possibilities of 
drug delivery and the absolute use of herbal drugs to target neurodegenerative 
diseases. The various possibilities of nanotechnology currently available with 
new emerging techniques are also discussed.

PURPOSE: This scoping review aimed to identify behavioral tests for central 
auditory processing (CAP) assessment that can be used to investigate early 
manifestations of pathological cognitive decline in adults and the older adults. 
Early detection of cognitive decline and dementias is a strategy for delaying 
the progression of these clinical conditions.
METHOD: This scoping review was conducted using various online databases and 
gray literature sources, including the Latin American and Caribbean Literature 
in Health Sciences, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and 
ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. Studies were included if they assessed 
individuals who underwent behavioral tests for CAP evaluation and had completed 
at least one cognitive test.
RESULTS: A total of 1,190 references were retrieved from the databases, with 151 
identified as duplicates. After screening 1,039 articles by title and abstract, 
eight studies were selected for full-text review, and five were included in the 
final synthesis. The behavioral tests for CAP evaluation used to investigate 
preclinical manifestations of cognitive decline and dementia were: Synthetic 
Sentence Identification With Ipsilateral Competing Message, Staggered Spondaic 
Word test, Dichotic Sentence Identification, and Dichotic Digits Test. Among 
these, dichotic tests were identified as having the strongest association with 
cognitive decline, probable Alzheimer's disease, or dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that dichotic tests are the most frequently 
utilized behavioral tests for CAP evaluation and serve as valuable tools for 
detecting early manifestations of cognitive decline and dementias. These tests 
could play a significant role in the early diagnosis and management of cognitive 
impairments.

Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that plays a 
critical role in endocytosis, trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. In 2010, 
BIN1 gene was reported as a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), which shifted the focus on its physiological and pathophysiological roles 
in the brain (at a time when data available were scarce). In this review, we 
discuss the multiple cerebral roles of BIN1, especially in regulating synaptic 
function, and the strong link between BIN1 and tau pathology, supported by 
recent evidence ranging from genetic and clinical/postmortem observations to 
molecular interactions.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and 
progression of Alzheimer's disease. In a previous study, we synthesized 
6-hydroxy-3'-propyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-propanoic acid (6OHA) based on the 
structure of magnaldehyde B, a natural compound that our group identified as a 
retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist. However, its potential effects on 
inflammation in microglial cells remain unexplored. In this study, we 
specifically focused on the early-phase inflammatory responses to 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated the inhibitory effects of 6OHA on BV-2 
microglial cells following 2 h of LPS exposure. Similar to the existing RXR 
agonist bexarotene (Bex), 6OHA treatment (0.1 and 1 μM) resulted in a 
dose-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory mediators, 
including interleukin-1β (Il1b), Il6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. 
However, these effects on proinflammatory mediators were effectively abolished 
by the RXR antagonist UVI3003. Additionally, 6OHA promoted M2 microglia 
polarization after 24 h of treatment, as evidenced by the increased mRNA levels 
of the M2 marker genes arginase-1 (Arg1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (Ccl6), 
Ccl17, and Ccl22. Notably, 6OHA induced a distinct set of M2 microglial markers 
compared with IL-4, a known M2 microglial inducer. Furthermore, the 
transcription of Arg1, a key M2 marker gene, is regulated by retinoic acid 
receptor/RXR heterodimers and the IL-4 signaling pathway. Collectively, 6OHA 
suppressed the early inflammatory responses to LPS and promoted M2 microglial 
polarization through a mechanism distinct from that of IL-4. Therefore, RXR 
agonists, including 6OHA and Bex, may exhibit dual anti-inflammatory effects and 
serve as novel modulators of neuroinflammation.

BACKGROUND: - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of dementia by 1.5 to 2.5 
times. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and metformin, widely 
used antidiabetic therapies, have demonstrated potential neuroprotective 
effects. Their comparative effectiveness in dementia prevention remains unknown.
METHODS: - This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX global federated 
network, analyzing de-identified records from over 98 healthcare organizations. 
Adults with T2D initiating SGLT2i or metformin as first-line therapy were 
propensity score-matched (1:1). The primary outcome was overall dementia 
incidence, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other subtypes. 
Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality. Time-to-event outcomes were 
assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models.
RESULTS: - Among 74,975 matched patients in each cohort, SGLT2i use was 
associated with a lower incidence of overall dementia: 2.7% vs. 6.9%: adjusted 
hazard ratio (aHR) 0.80 [95% CI 0.76;0.84]. Reductions were observed in vascular 
dementia (0.8% vs. 2.0%; aHR 0.87), Alzheimer's dementia (1.1% vs. 3.2%; aHR, 
0.76), and all-cause mortality (6.8% vs. 15.4%; aHR, 0.92). Benefits were 
pronounced in older adults, particularly those aged ≥80 years.
CONCLUSIONS: - SGLT2is significantly reduced dementia risk and mortality 
compared to metformin in T2D patients. These findings suggest SGLT2is may offer 
superior neuroprotective benefits, underscoring their potential as a first-line 
therapy for T2D. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) in reducing dementia risk 
among older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), compared to dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i).
METHODS: Using the TriNetX electronic health records network, we conducted a 
retrospective cohort study including adults aged ≥65 years with T2DM who 
initiated SGLT2i or DPP4i between January 1, 2013, and November 30, 2024. 
Propensity score matching was employed to create two balanced cohorts, with the 
primary outcome being new-onset dementia. Secondary outcomes included 
dementia-related drug use and subtypes of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease 
and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 80,376 patients were included in each 
group. SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing 
dementia compared to DPP4i (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95 % confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.51-0.57; p < 0.001). Similar reductions were observed for 
dementia-related drug use (HR, 0.69; 95 % CI: 0.64-0.74; p < 0.001), Alzheimer's 
disease (HR, 0.53; 95 % CI: 0.48-0.60; p < 0.001), and vascular dementia (HR, 
0.52; 95 % CI: 0.46-0.58; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed consistent 
protective effects.
CONCLUSION: Compared to DPP-4i, SGLT2i use is associated with a lower risk of 
dementia in older adults with T2DM, with consistent benefits observed across 
diverse populations and patient subgroups. These findings highlight the 
potential of SGLT2i as a preventive strategy for cognitive decline and support 
further investigation in randomized controlled trials.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation in proteins 
are involved in healthy aging and a variety of diseases including Alzheimer's 
disease, atherosclerosis, and diabetic complications. However, the biological 
effects of the non-enzymatic modification of aminophospholipids (lipid-AGEs) at 
cellular level are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the 
effects of lipid-AGEs on angiogenesis, inflammation, insulin signaling, and 
mitochondrial function in human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGEC), 
exploring their potential role in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy 
(DN).
METHODS: HRGEC cells were exposed to non-enzymatically modified 
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by AGEs (lipid-AGEs), non-modified PE (nmPE) 
(aminophospholipid without modification) was employed as a negative control, and 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as a positive control. Angiogenesis was assessed 
through vascular network formation metrics, including capillary area, junction 
density, and endpoints, under different extracellular matrices. Gene expression 
of inflammatory and angiogenic markers was quantified by RT-qPCR. Insulin 
signaling components, including IRS1 and AKT phosphorylation, were evaluated by 
immunoblotting. Mitochondrial function was assessed using high-resolution 
respirometry to determine ATP production rates from glycolysis and oxidative 
phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Lipid-AGEs induced dose-, time-, and matrix-dependent angiogenesis, 
with effects comparable to LPS, particularly in Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm ECM 
(capillary area increase: 25%, p<0.05). Lipid-AGEs significantly upregulated the 
inflammatory genes IL8 and NFKB (p<0.05), and the angiogenesis-related markers 
TGFB1 and ANGPT2 (p<0.05). Insulin signaling was disrupted, as lipid-AGEs 
enhanced inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS1 (Ser-1101, 1.8-fold increase, 
p<0.01) and modulated AKT (Ser-473) and p42/p44 ERK activation. At lower doses, 
lipid-AGEs reduced eNOS phosphorylation (p<0.05) impairing insulin 
responsiveness. High-resolution respirometry revealed that lipid-AGEs reduced 
basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) by 20% (p<0.05), with no significant 
changes in glycolytic ATP production.
CONCLUSION: Lipid-AGEs induce angiogenesis, inflammation, and insulin signaling 
disruption in HRGEC, contributing to endothelial dysfunction. These findings 
underscore the potential role of lipid-AGEs in age-related decline of renal 
function, as well as the pathogenic potential in DN highlighting their relevance 
as therapeutic targets for mitigating vascular and metabolic complications in 
diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that neuroinflammation is involved 
in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to RNA sequencing and 
quantitative PCR (qPCR), we found that chemokine CCL3 mRNA expression was 
abnormally upregulated in the brains of AD transgenic mice. Moreover, the levels 
of CCL3 in the serum of AD patients were significantly elevated and negatively 
correlated with their cognitive abilities. However, the role of CCL3 in AD 
neuroinflammation and pathological damages remains elusive.
METHODS: Using behavioral, histological, and biochemical methods, outcomes of 
CCL3 antibody treatment on neuropathology and cognitive deficits were studied in 
the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.
RESULTS: In the present study, we reported that CCL3 protein expression was 
increased in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, whereas blockage of CCL3 with neutralizing 
antibody potently inhibited CCL3 activation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice down to 
the levels of wild-type mice. Specifically, CCL3 antibody significantly improved 
the learning and memory abilities of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition, CCL3 
antibody treatment decreased cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and plaque burden 
via inhibiting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by reducing beta-site 
APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. We also 
found that CCL3 antibody treatment alleviated neuroinflammation and reduced 
synaptic defects in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Furthermore, the activated NF-κB 
signaling pathway in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice was inhibited by CCL3 antibody 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings provide evidence that CCL3 activation 
may contribute to the AD pathogenesis and may serve as a novel therapeutic 
target in the treatment of AD.

Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP) is a natural bioactive compound known for 
its promising health benefits, including antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and 
anti-inflammatory effects. However, its potential in combating aging remains 
largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the anti-aging effects of BSP 
in the Drosophila melanogaster model. The results show that BSP supplementation 
significantly extends the lifespan of flies in a concentration-dependent manner, 
with the most pronounced effects observed at a concentration of 3 mg/mL. 
Lifespan extension is associated with enhanced antioxidative capacities, as 
evidenced by increased SOD and CAT activities, and decreased MDA content. 
Additionally, BSP ameliorates age-related symptoms, including improved climbing 
ability and enhanced intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, BSP 
supplementation enhances resistance to H2O2-induced oxidative and starvation 
stresses, attenuates the lead (Pb)-induced toxicity, and delays the onset of 
Alzheimer's phenotypes in flies. RNA-Seq analysis reveals that BSP 
supplementation leads to the differential expression of 992 genes. KEGG pathway 
analysis highlights significant changes in metabolic pathways, including 
galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and carbon metabolism. Key 
genes such as Mal-A1, Amy-d, Men-b, Pgm-1, Mdh1, and Hex-C are downregulated, 
while CG32026, CG11291, and Ald2 are upregulated. These findings suggest BSP 
exhibits significant anti-aging and protective properties, making it a potential 
therapeutic agent.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
marked by complex pathologies. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) plays a 
pivotal role in AD pathogenesis, influencing key pathological processes such as 
hyperphosphorylation of tau and production of amyloid-beta. However, current 
methods for detecting GSK-3β in living cells and tissues are limited in 
sensitivity and real-time tracking. Herein, we reported a series of 
environment-sensitive fluorescent probes to detect GSK-3β in both living cells 
and brain slices. These probes exhibit fluorescence upon the binding of GSK-3β, 
providing high sensitivity and selectivity with minimal background interference. 
Compound 10c was further validated in an AD mouse model with elevated expression 
of GSK-3β, showing clear imaging in hippocampal regions. Compared to 
immunofluorescence, compound 10c demonstrated a lower background and faster 
labeling. In addition, this compound showed neuroprotective effects, supporting 
its potential as a theranostic tool in AD. These findings provide new tools for 
investigating the role of GSK-3β in AD and advancing targeted therapies.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent, emerge early, and are associated 
with poorer outcomes in Lewy body dementia (LBD). Research suggests NPS may 
reflect LBD-related dysfunction in distributed neuronal networks. This study 
investigated NPS neural correlates in prodromal LBD using resting-state 
functional MRI. Fifty-seven participants were included with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB, n = 28) or Parkinson's disease 
(PD-MCI, n = 29). Functional MRI assessed connectivity within five resting-state 
networks: primary visual, dorsal attention, salience, limbic, and default mode 
networks. NPS were measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Principal 
component analyses identified three neuropsychiatric factors: affective disorder 
(apathy, depression), psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) and anxiety. 
Seed-to-voxel connectivity maps were analysed to determine associations between 
NPS and network connectivity. In PD-MCI, affective symptoms and anxiety were 
associated with greater connectivity between limbic orbitofrontal cortex and 
default mode areas, including medial prefrontal cortex, subgenual cingulate and 
precuneus, and weaker connectivity between limbic orbitofrontal cortex and the 
brainstem and between the salience network and medial prefrontal cortex (all 
pFWE<0.001). Psychosis severity in PD-MCI correlated with connectivity across 
multiple networks (all pFWE<0.001). In MCI-LB, no significant correlations were 
found between NPS severity and network connectivity. However, participants with 
anxiety demonstrated a trend towards greater connectivity within medial 
prefrontal areas than those without (pFWE=0.046). Altered connectivity within 
and between networks associated with mood disorders may explain affective and 
anxiety symptoms in PD-MCI. Neural correlates of NPS in MCI-LB, however, remain 
unclear, highlighting the need for research in larger, more diverse LBD 
populations to identify symptomatic treatment targets.

Lesion-symptom mapping methods assess the relationship between lesions caused by 
cerebral small vessel disease and cognition, but current technology like support 
vector regression (SVR)) primarily provide group-level results. We propose a 
novel lesion-symptom mapping approach that can indicate how lesion patterns 
contribute to cognitive impairment on an individual level. A convolutional 
neural network (CNN) predicts cognitive scores and is combined with explainable 
artificial intelligence (XAI) to map the relation between cognition and vascular 
lesions. This method was evaluated primarily using real white matter 
hyperintensity maps of 821 memory clinic patients and simulated cognitive data, 
with weighted lesions and noise levels. Simulated data provided ground truth 
locations to assess predictive performance of the CNN and accuracy of strategic 
lesion identification by XAI, using an established lesion-symptom mapping 
method, SVR, and a simple fully connected neural network (FNN) as benchmarks. 
Real cognitive scores were used in a final proof-of-principle analysis. 
Predictive performance in simulation experiments was high for the CNN 
(R2 = 0.964), SVR (R2 = 0.875), and FNN (R2 = 0.863). CNN with XAI provided 
patient-specific attribution maps that highlighted the ground truth locations. 
All methods showed similar sensitivity to noise. Using real cognitive scores, 
SVR (R2 = 0.291) obtained a somewhat higher predictive performance than the CNN 
(R2 = 0.216), although both methods substantially exceeded the predictive 
performance of total WMH volume alone (R2 = 0.013). The FNN performed worse on 
real data (R2 = 0.020). To conclude, results show that CNNs combined with XAI 
can perform lesion-symptom mapping and generate individual attribution maps, 
which could be a valuable feature with further method development.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Young-onset dementia (YOD) poses substantial societal 
and health care burdens. Although metabolic syndrome (MetS) is recognized as a 
contributor to late-onset dementia, its effect on YOD remains unclear. This 
study aimed to determine whether MetS and its individual components increase the 
risk of YOD, including all-cause dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular 
dementia (VaD).
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study using data from 
the Korean National Insurance Service. Individuals aged 40-60 who underwent 
national health check-ups in 2009 were included and followed until December 31, 
2020, or age 65, whichever came first. MetS was defined according to established 
guidelines, incorporating measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, 
fasting glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 
Covariates included age, sex, income level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, 
and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and depression. 
The primary outcome was incident all-cause YOD, defined as a dementia diagnosis 
before age 65; secondary outcomes included young-onset AD and VaD. Multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 
95% CIs.
RESULTS: A total of 1,979,509 participants (mean age, 49.0 years; 51.3% men; 
50.7% with MetS) were included. Over an average follow-up of 7.75 years, 8,921 
individuals (0.45%) developed YOD. MetS was associated with a 24% higher risk of 
all-cause YOD (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), a 12.4% increased risk of AD 
(HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), and a 20.9% increased risk of VaD (HR 1.21, 95% CI 
1.08-1.35). Significant interactions were noted with younger age (40-49 vs 
50-59), female sex, drinking status, obesity, and depression.
DISCUSSION: In this large Korean cohort, MetS and its individual components were 
significantly associated with an increased risk of YOD. These findings suggest 
that interventions targeting MetS may help mitigate YOD risk. However, the 
observational design precludes definitive causal inferences, and reliance on 
claims data could introduce misclassification bias. Future research using 
longitudinal designs and comprehensive data collection is needed to validate and 
expand on these associations.

BackgroundSerum trace elements, anthropometric data, and oxidative stress 
markers are often altered in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
other types of dementia (OTD). However, these parameters are rarely examined 
together before disease onset in a single study population.ObjectiveThis nested 
case-control study aims to investigate anthropometric data, serum trace 
elements, exchangeable copper (CuEXC), and oxidative stress markers to identify 
early associations with the risk of AD or OTD.MethodsFrom the European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam cohort (DRKS-ID: 
DRKS00020593), the High Fat Diet, Microbiota, and Neuroinflammation in the 
Progression of Alzheimer study was generated. One hundred twenty-eight 
individuals who developed AD or OTD were identified, approximately 15.7 years 
after baseline data collection, and matched for age, sex, fasting status, and 
season of blood sampling with 512 controls. Serum levels of manganese (Mn), iron 
(Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), iodine (I), CuEXC, and plasma 
malondialdehyde (MDA) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) were analyzed.ResultsCases and 
non-cases did not differ in anthropometric data or oxidative stress markers. 
Female cases exhibited a trend of elevated serum Cu and CuEXC levels compared to 
female non-cases. A higher Se/Cu ratio suggested an inverse association 
(OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.92), while an increased Cu/Zn ratio was positively 
associated (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.1) with AD or OTD 
incidence.ConclusionsRatios of serum trace elements, rather than individual 
levels, show early associations with the risk of AD or OTD while anthropometric 
and oxidative stress markers did not.

BackgroundCerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is one of the most important 
causes of cognitive decline. Only a few previous studies have evaluated lung 
function measures in relation to brain neuropathological changes, and even less 
studies on specific lesions and areas that could shed light on mechanisms of 
CSVD.ObjectiveThe aim was to study the association between lung function and 
CSVD in the general elder population.Methods379 participants, aged 72-87 years 
from the general population study 'Good Aging in Skåne study (GÅS)'were 
investigated with a 3 T MRI brain examination and spirometry. Z-scores of FEV1 
and FVC were calculated using the GLI 2012 equations. Age-adjusted associations 
between white matter hyperintensities (WMH), medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), 
lacunar infarction, cerebral atrophies and cerebral microbleeds and lung 
function were calculated and stratified for sex.ResultsDecreased FEV1 and FVC 
z-scores below ≤ -1.0 were both associated with increased risk of WMI and global 
cortical atrophy. Decreased FVC z-scores were also associated with MTA and 
lacunar infarction in women and precuneus atrophy in men. The associations for 
WMH, MTA and lacunar infarctions and higher STRIVE score were noted among women, 
but not among men. FEV1 z scores were not related to diabetes, coronary artery 
disease or stroke.ConclusionsLower lung function was associated to MRI markers 
of CSVD in this general healthy population, particularly with WMH, especially 
for women. Although possible shared risk factors exist between lung and heart 
disease, lung function should be recognized in future studies on CSVD.

BackgroundThe triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is considered a robust surrogate 
for insulin resistance (IR). The relationship between the trajectory patterns of 
the TyG index and subsequent brain structure changes is still 
unclear.ObjectiveThis study investigates the relationship between 10-year 
trajectories of TyG-related indices and brain structural integrity in a 10-year 
follow-up.MethodsThis prospective study included 898 participants (mean age 55.6 
years, 34.4% males) from the community-based Shunyi Study. IR was assessed using 
the TyG index, TyG-body mass index (BMI) index, TyG-waist circumference index, 
and TyG-waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) index. The group-based trajectory model was 
employed to identify the 10-year trajectories. Structural brain measurements 
included structural changes of the whiter matter (white matter hyperintensities 
(WMHs), fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity) and gray matter (brain 
parenchymal fraction (BPF), cortical thickness, and hippocampal volume). General 
linear models were utilized to examine the association between the trajectory 
patterns of TyG-related indices and brain structure.ResultsThree distinct 
trajectories of TyG-related indices were identified from 2013 to 2023. The 
high-level trajectory groups of TyG-related indices exhibited a greater volume 
of WMHs and were more susceptible to disruptions in white matter microstructural 
integrity. This association was most significant for the TyG-BMI and TyG-WHtR 
trajectory groups. No significant correlations were found for BPF and cortical 
thickness among the different TyG-related indices trajectories.ConclusionsThe 
findings suggest that long-term IR primarily damages brain white matter rather 
than causing structural changes in gray matter.

Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are 
neurodegenerative disorders that afflict 1 in 9 older adults. As pharmacological 
interventions for ADRD are often ineffective and cause rampant side effects, 
interest has increased in finding adjunctive, non-pharmacological approaches. 
Music therapy may be especially beneficial for individuals with ADRD and their 
caregivers as music is a form of non-verbal communication. Objective: In this 
case series, we describe a 12-week group music therapy program for individuals 
with ADRD and their caregivers. Methods: Brain activity was recorded with 
hyperscanning electroencephalography (EEG) during each music therapy session 
from the individual with ADRD (n = 3), caregiver (n = 3), and music therapist 
(n = 1). Video recordings allowed for assessment of movement behavior and 
affective state responses. Results: This 12-week case series of group music 
therapy for individuals and their caregivers had a 66% retention and 95.8% 
adherence rate. We had success collecting behavioral and neural data using 
360-degree video capture in combination with EEG. Video recordings allowed us to 
analyze affective state and nonverbal communication metrics. After 
pre-processing, neural recordings were clean and able to be analyzed for various 
neural metrics of interest. Conclusions: A human-centered design approach can be 
helpful for implementing longitudinal, non-pharmacological interventions in this 
vulnerable population. A team-science approach with a collective of creative 
arts therapists, neuroscientists, dementia care experts, creative technologists, 
and gerontology experts contributed to the conduction of this work. Future 
studies should examine the effects of music therapy on behavioral and neural 
outcomes, especially as it relates to interpersonal behavioral and neural 
synchrony.

Brain deposition of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a 
feature of neurodegenerative syndromes. We evaluated TDP-43 plasma 
concentrations in 1058 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a 
population-based longitudinal cohort. The cohort was 38% male, 11% Black, had a 
mean age 75 years, and 261 people developed dementia over a mean of 5.5 years of 
follow up. Median TDP-43 levels were 211.0 pg/mL (IQR: 134.0-341.0 pg/mL). 
TDP-43 levels were not associated with cross-sectional or longitudinal change in 
cognitive scores, with plasma AD biomarkers, with brain MRI volumes, with 
incident dementia, or with demographic characteristics.

BackgroundThe alternative splicing (AS) of MAPT, which encodes Tau, in the adult 
human brain produces six major isoforms that play critical roles in the 
pathogenesis of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Previous efforts have 
failed to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to 
cortical neurons expressing the six isoforms of Tau.ObjectiveWe aim to develop a 
differentiation method capable of producing the six Tau isoforms in 
hiPSC-derived cortical neurons.MethodsWe searched for the optimal concentration, 
duration and treatment window of morphogens in the differentiation of hiPSCs 
through embryoid bodies (EBs) to dorsal forebrain neuroepithelial cells then to 
cortical neurons.ResultsThe combined inhibition of WNT, SHH, and SMAD signaling 
in EBs generated neuroepithelial cells expressing appropriate dorsal forebrain 
markers, while suppressing ventral, midbrain, and hindbrain genes. Further 
differentiation in neurogenic and neurotrophic factors produced MAP2+ neurons at 
day 18. The iPSC-derived neurons expressed markers of all cortical layers and 
exhibited synapse formation and synaptic physiology. In addition, MAP2+ neurons 
and mitotic cells expressing radial glial markers formed aggregates that could 
be dissociated to produce mature neurons with similar properties. Most 
importantly, the six Tau isoforms were expressed from day 80 in a 
developmentally regulated manner, modeling the situation in human brains on an 
accelerated timeline.ConclusionsThis chemically defined differentiation method 
produces a key hallmark of mature human cortical neurons by expressing the six 
main splicing isoforms of Tau. It will greatly facilitate disease modeling and 
therapeutic discovery for many human brain disorders involving cortical neurons.

BackgroundCurrent therapies for cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, are limited by a lack of universal 
treatment and adverse effects associated with polypharmacy. Investigating 
genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive decline is critical for 
the development of targeted therapeutics.ObjectiveTo identify causal genes and 
potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairment through integrative 
genomic analyses.MethodsGenome-wide association study data on cognitive 
impairment were combined with the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data 
from the eQTLGen consortium. Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization 
analyses were employed to infer causal relationships. Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis and Gene Set Variation Analysis evaluated the pathway and functional 
differences. Immune cell infiltration patterns and the immunometabolic pathways 
were assessed, followed by drug target prediction.ResultsMR analysis identified 
seven gene-eQTL pairs significantly associated with cognitive impairment. SMR 
colocalization prioritized three key genes: HNMT (histamine metabolism), TNFSF8 
(inflammatory signaling), and S1PR5 (sphingolipid signaling). HNMT, TNFSF8, and 
S1PR5 had 39, 24, and 30 predicted targeted drugs, respectively, including 
arsenic trioxide, aspirin, and immunomodulators.ConclusionsThis study implicates 
HNMT, TNFSF8, and S1PR5 as potential therapeutic targets for cognitive 
impairment. Further validation is required to confirm their clinical relevance.

BackgroundThe involvement of microglia is likely to be pivotal in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulating the deposition of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. The deletion of Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) has a 
protective effect in mouse with neurodegenerative diseases.ObjectiveTo explore 
the underlying mechanism of DOCK8 in AD.MethodsIn present study, we first the 
detected the expression of DOCK8 in the hippocampal tissue of APP/PS1 mice. 
Then, the expression of DOCK8 was knocked down in the hippocampal tissue of 
APP/PS1 mice, and the effects of DOCK8 down-regulation on cognitive function, 
the microglia migration around Aβ plaques, and the cell division cycle 42 
(Cdc42)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway were 
detected. Next, the effects of DOCK8 knockdown on Aβ-induced migration and 
activation of BV-2 cells as well as the MAPK signaling pathway were detected. 
Finally, the transcriptional regulation of DOCK by transcription factor 3 (ATF3) 
was detected by a dual luciferase reporter assay.ResultsDOCK8 expression exerts 
a significant upregulation in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. However, 
following the DOCK8 knockdown, there was a significant recovery in the results 
of the behavioral tests and a notable reduction in microglial expression. 
Moreover, the high expression of DOCK8 mediated by ATF3 successfully triggered 
the Cdc42/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, thereby enhancing the migration and 
recruitment of microglia towards senile plaques, accelerating the production of 
Aβ plaques.ConclusionsATF3-mediated high expression of DOCK8 accelerates the 
production of Aβ plaques, and participates in the pathogenesis of AD.

BackgroundLow-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), a non-invasive targeted brain 
stimulation technology, has shown promise for therapeutic applications in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Despite its potential, the implications of 
repeated LIFU neuromodulation in AD patients remain to be 
investigated.ObjectiveThis pilot study evaluated the safety and potential to 
improve cognition and functional connectivity following repeated LIFU treatment 
in AD patients.MethodsTen early-stage AD patients underwent six sessions of 
neuronavigation-guided LIFU targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) within 2-3 weeks, alongside ongoing standard pharmacotherapy. 
Neuropsychological assessments and resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging were performed at baseline and eight weeks post-treatment.ResultsMemory 
performance (p = 0.02) and functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and 
both the left perirhinal cortex and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex 
(corrected p < 0.05) significantly improved from baseline. Additionally, 
enhancements in memory performance were positively correlated with increases in 
functional connectivity of the left DLPFC with the left perirhinal cortex 
(Kendall's tau = 0.56, p = 0.03). No adverse events were reported during the 
LIFU treatments or at the subsequent follow-up.ConclusionsLIFU may have the 
therapeutic potential to enhance both brain network connectivity and memory 
functions in AD patients. Our results provide a basis for further research, 
including randomized sham-controlled trials and optimization of stimulation 
protocols, on LIFU as a supplementary or alternative treatment option for 
AD.Trial registrationClinical Research Information Service, KCT0008169,

BackgroundImpairments in orientation in space, time, and person occur frequently 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Subtle changes in orientation may arise in 
preclinical and prodromal disease stages. Thus, assessing orientation may help 
identify those on a trajectory toward AD dementia.ObjectiveTo investigate how 
orientation, measured using a novel artificial intelligence-based paradigm, 
relates to AD biomarkers (amyloid and tau) in cognitively unimpaired older 
adults.MethodsUsing an automated chatbot, 53 cognitively unimpaired participants 
(74.0 ± 5.5 years; 60% female) provided details about memories and 
relationships, recognition of historical event dates, and geographical 
locations. These details were then used to assess orientation to space, time, 
and person. For each domain separately, orientation accuracy was calculated by 
dividing the number of correct responses by response time. All participants 
underwent Pittsburgh compound-B (amyloid) and flortaucipir (tau) positron 
emission tomography. We analyzed the relationship between performance on the 
three orientation domains and retrosplenial, precuneus, neocortical, and medial 
temporal tau, and global amyloid.ResultsHigher retrosplenial and precuneus tau 
burden were associated with worse temporal orientation (β = -0.32, 95% 
confidence interval [95%CI] = [-0.59, -0.05] and β = -0.29, 95%CI = [-0.57, 
-0.01], respectively). Spatial or social orientation were not associated with 
amyloid or tau.ConclusionsThese results suggest that impaired temporal 
orientation is related to AD pathological processes, even before the onset of 
overt cognitive impairment, and may infer a role for personalized assessment of 
orientation in early diagnosis of AD.

On January 1, 2024, a major earthquake struck Japan's Noto Peninsula. From 2021 
to 2023, we conducted a baseline survey. Four months after the disaster, we 
conducted a follow-up survey to investigate the relationship between house 
damage and forgetfulness in older adults without dementia. A total of 923 
individuals were included. Among the respondents, 32.2% and 33.8% reported as 
suffered major house damages and increased forgetfulness, respectively. 
Multivariate analysis revealed major house damage was significantly associated 
with self-reported forgetfulness, which are partly mediated through sleep 
disturbance and sedentary behavior in the cognitively unimpaired and mild 
cognitive impairment groups, respectively.

BackgroundLecanemab, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-β plaques, is 
FDA-approved for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. However, safety data 
from daily clinical practice is limited.ObjectiveThis study aims to assess the 
adverse events (AEs) linked to lecanemab using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting 
System (FAERS) to inform better safety management.MethodsA retrospective 
pharmacovigilance study was conducted using FAERS data from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024. 
Disproportionality analysis, including reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional 
reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), 
and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker (MGPS), was applied to evaluate AEs where 
lecanemab was the primary suspect drug.ResultsFrom Q1 2023 to Q2 2024, 917 AEs 
related to lecanemab were recorded in the FAERS database, with 67.2% of patients 
aged between 65 and 85 years and 54.5% involving women. Disproportionality 
analysis identified significant AEs across 22 organ systems, particularly 
nervous system and psychiatric disorders. Common AEs included headache, 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, and infusion-related reactions, while 
sleep-related issues like somnolence, abnormal dreams, and poor-quality sleep 
were notable. Median onset time was 48 days, with serious outcomes in 14.3% of 
cases, including 70 hospitalizations and 15 deaths.ConclusionsThis 
pharmacovigilance analysis confirms known AEs of lecanemab and highlights new 
safety concerns, particularly its impact on sleep. These findings underscore the 
importance of ongoing monitoring and research to enhance lecanemab's safety 
profile in AD treatment. However, due to the limitations of FAERS, our analysis 
is imperfect in terms of important AEs such as therapy-related brain loss and 
death.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cortical atrophy, 
glutamatergic neuron loss, and cognitive decline. However, large-scale 
quantitative assessments of cellular changes during AD pathology remain 
scarce.ObjectiveThis study aims to integrate single-nuclei sequencing data from 
the Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Cortical Atlas (SEA-AD) with spatial 
transcriptomics to quantify cellular changes in the prefrontal cortex and 
temporal gyrus, regions vulnerable to AD neuropathological changes 
(ADNC).MethodsWe mapped differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and analyzed their 
interactions with pathological factors such as APOE expression and Lewy bodies. 
Cellular proportions were assessed, focusing on neurons, glial cells, and immune 
cells.ResultsRORB-expressing L4-like neurons, though vulnerable to ADNC, 
exhibited stable cell numbers throughout disease progression. In contrast, 
astrocytes displayed increased reactivity, with upregulated cytokine signaling 
and oxidative stress responses, suggesting a role in neuroinflammation. A 
reduction in synaptic maintenance pathways indicated a decline in astrocytic 
support functions. Microglia showed heightened immune surveillance and 
phagocytic activity, indicating their role in maintaining cortical 
homeostasis.ConclusionsThe study underscores the critical roles of glial cells, 
particularly astrocytes and microglia, in AD progression. These findings 
contribute to a better understanding of cellular dynamics and may inform 
therapeutic strategies targeting glial cell function in AD.

BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by cognitive deficit and pathological accumulation of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins. The rodent models have contributed greatly to 
unravel AD pathogenesis, but these AD models have been shown a modest clinical 
translational effectiveness.ObjectiveTherefore, developing mass-producible 
primate AD models is promising for more effective drug development.MethodsHere, 
we constructed the AD monkey models by simultaneously infusing AAV-Tau and Aβ 
into different brain regions.ResultsThe induced monkeys showed a durable 
cognitive impairment lasting for at least 10 months after the modeling. 
Simultaneously, the increased levels of total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau 
(pTau) at several AD-associated sites, and neurofilament light chains (NfL) with 
altered Aβ level were detected at different time points in cerebrospinal fluid 
and/or plasma by using MSD kits. The increased brain accumulation of Aβ and tau 
proteins was also detected by positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance 
imaging and immunohistochemical staining. The model monkeys also had significant 
glial activation; an indicator of inflammation commonly seen in the brains of AD 
patients.ConclusionsTogether, this study provides mass-producible monkey models 
showing durable AD-like hallmark pathologies (Aβ, tau, NfL, i.e., ATN) and 
cognitive deficits. As monkeys are genetically and metabolically the closest to 
humans, these models will offer more effective drug discovery and development 
for AD.

BackgroundNeuropsychological (NP) assessment is crucial for diagnosing prodromal 
and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) syndromes. Yet, traditional 
NP scores often overlook errors and the process by which summary scores are 
obtained; information that can provide deeper insights into cognitive 
impairments and clinical heterogeneity.ObjectiveTo classify community-dwelling 
adults into neurocognitive phenotypes, identify NP test errors and processes 
that differentiate between groups, and explore their association with brain 
imaging measures.MethodsFramingham Heart Study (FHS) data were analyzed, 
focusing on NP summary scores and errors derived from the Boston Process 
Approach. Latent class analysis identified distinct neurocognitive phenotypes. 
Regression analyses assessed the relationships with NP errors and brain MRI 
measures.ResultsA total of 1195 participants (mean age 69.6 and 56.3% women) 
were included. Cognitively normal (CN), moderate-mixed, and dysexecutive 
impairment groups were identified. The number of Trail Making Test - Part B 
(TMT-B) pen lifts and TMT-B examiner-corrected errors were associated with the 
dysexecutive phenotype and differentiated it from the CN group (OR = 1.39, 95% 
CI = 1.28-1.52, p < 0.001, AUC = 0.85 and OR = 3.40, 95% CI = 2.65-4.38, 
p < 0.001, AUC = 0.92; respectively). Similarly, Boston Naming Test (BNT) 
circumlocution errors were associated with the moderate-mixed phenotype and 
differentiated it from the CN group (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.49-2.35, p < 0.001, 
AUC = 0.81). These scores were significantly associated with reduced hippocampal 
volumes.ConclusionsDetailed NP error and process analysis enhances traditional 
methods, offering a comprehensive approach to identifying and understanding 
cognitive impairments.

BackgroundStudies suggest that plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers may 
aid in the overall diagnosis of AD, but their utility among patients with 
atypical clinical presentations of AD are unknown.ObjectiveThe main objective of 
this study was to determine the relationship between amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau 
plasma biomarkers and PET measures of both Aβ and tau in atypical AD. The 
secondary objective was to determine if plasma biomarkers could differentiate 
patients with different atypical AD phenotypes and whether they were related to 
measures of disease severity.MethodsWe assessed whether plasma p-tau 181 and 
Aβ42/40 were associated with Aβ and tau PET uptake, clinical phenotype and 
severity in 77 patients with PET biomarker-confirmed atypical AD.ResultsPlasma 
Aβ42/40 ratio showed positive associations with tau PET uptake, with higher 
(more normal) Aβ42/40 ratio associated with higher tau uptake; the ratio was not 
associated with Aβ PET. No associations were noted with plasma p-tau 181. Plasma 
Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau 181 concentrations were not associated with AD phenotype 
or cognitive severity.ConclusionPlasma Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau 181 
concentrations are not associated with amyloid or tau PET or with clinical 
severity among individuals presenting with atypical AD.

AIM: DNA methylation in brain regions represents a potential mechanism linking 
genetic variation to Alzheimer's disease (ad) risk, yet most studies have 
focused on blood-derived methylation markers. In this study, we conducted a 
systematic Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate associations between 
predicted brain region-specific DNA methylation levels and ad risk, using 
methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) as genetic instruments.
METHODS: We analyzed mQTLs from five human brain regions: cerebellum (CRBLM), 
frontal cortex (FCTX), causal pons (PONS), and temporal cortex (TCTX) from 600 
individuals in Gibbs et al's study, as well as mQTLs from dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 543 participants in the Religious Orders Study and 
the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). In our MR analyses, we integrated 
these mQTLs with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-ad risk summary 
statistics derived from 85 934 ad-related cases and 401 577 normal controls.
RESULTS: Among 62 554 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, we identified 
597 CpG sites (CpGs) significantly associated with ad risk (false discovery rate 
(FDR) < 0.05). Of these, 289 were confirmed through colocalization and 
summary-based MR (SMR) analyses, including one CpG site in CRBLM, 285 in DLPFC, 
one in FCTX, two in PONS, and one in TCTX. By integrating gene expression data, 
we identified 19 CpG sites with consistent associations across methylation 
levels, expression of eight target genes, and ad risk, including novel 
regulatory mechanisms involving RITA1's modulation of cg11558705 and PCGF3's 
regulation of cg10009224.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight brain region-specific DNA methylation as a 
mediator of genetic risk for ad, offering insights into ad pathogenesis and 
identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Neurodegenerative diseases display synaptic deficits, mitochondrial defects, and 
protein aggregation. We show that intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
regulates axoplasmic viscosity and protein aggregation in mammalian neurons. 
Decreased intracellular ATP upon mitochondrial inhibition leads to axoterminal 
cytosol, synaptic vesicles, and active zone component condensation, modulating 
the functional organization of mouse glutamatergic synapses. Proteins involved 
in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) condensed and underwent ATP-dependent liquid 
phase separation in vitro. Human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons 
from patients with PD and ALS displayed reduced axoplasmic fluidity and 
decreased intracellular ATP. Last, nicotinamide mononucleotide treatment 
successfully rescued intracellular ATP levels and axoplasmic viscosity in 
neurons from patients with PD and ALS and reduced TAR DNA-binding protein 43 
(TDP-43) aggregation in human motor neurons derived from a patient with ALS. 
Thus, our data suggest that the hydrotropic activity of ATP contributes to the 
regulation of neuronal homeostasis under both physiological and pathological 
conditions.

Lonicera japonica Thunb. (L. japonica) is an edible-medicinal herb. While the 
flower buds of L. japonica are commonly utilized for medicinal purposes, the 
flowers are often overlooked. However, it has been discovered that the flowers 
contain higher levels of certain active compounds compared to the flower buds. 
Despite this finding, there have been no reports on the potential differences in 
pharmacological efficacy between these compounds. Utilizing results from GC-MS 
and LC-MS, a total of 335 differential compounds were identified, of which 247 
complied with Lipinski's Rule of Five concerning medicinal properties. Among 
these, 101 compounds were upregulated in the flower buds, while 146 compounds 
were upregulated in the flowers. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that the 
upregulated compounds from the flower buds and flowers targeted 143 and 185 core 
targets, respectively, with 116 being duplicates. The core target proteins among 
the duplicate targets were primarily involved in pathways related to cancer, 
lipid and atherosclerosis, hepatitis B, proteoglycans in cancer, and Alzheimer's 
disease. Meanwhile, the hub target proteins upregulated in the flowers enriched 
distinct pathways associated with human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, focal 
adhesion, the thyroid hormone signaling pathway, and fluid shear stress and 
atherosclerosis. Molecular docking results indicated that the upregulated 
compounds exhibited strong binding affinity to the core targets. This study 
provides insights into the differences in active components between the 
medicinal (flower buds) and non-medicinal (flowers) raw materials predicting the 
mechanisms of action of these active components and establishing a basis for the 
more rational utilization of L. japonica flowers.

Aβ is believed to play a significant role in synaptic degeneration observed in 
Alzheimer's disease and is primarily investigated as a secreted peptide. 
However, the contribution of intracellular Aβ or other cleavage products of its 
precursor protein (APP) to synaptic loss remains uncertain. In this study, we 
conducted a systematic examination of their cell-autonomous impact using a 
sparse expression system in rat hippocampal slice culture. Here, these 
proteins/peptides were overexpressed in a single neuron, surrounded by thousands 
of untransfected neurons. Surprisingly, we found that APP induced dendritic 
spine loss only when co-expressed with BACE1. This effect was mediated by β-CTF, 
a β-cleavage product of APP, through an endosome-related pathway independent of 
Aβ. Neuronal expression of β-CTF in mouse brains resulted in defective synaptic 
transmission and cognitive impairments, even in the absence of amyloid plaques. 
These findings unveil a β-CTF-initiated mechanism driving synaptic toxicity 
irrespective of amyloid plaque formation and suggest a potential intervention by 
inhibiting the endosomal GTPase Rab5.

Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related disorders characterized by the 
cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and cellular senescence 
underlies their pathogenesis. Thus, it is necessary for preventing these 
diseases to remove toxic proteins, repair damaged neurons, and suppress cellular 
senescence. As a source for such prophylactic agents, we selected zizyphi 
spinosi semen (ZSS), a medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. Oral 
administration of ZSS hot water extract ameliorated Aβ and tau pathology and 
cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal 
dementia. Non-extracted ZSS simple crush powder showed stronger effects than the 
extract and improved α-synuclein pathology and cognitive/motor function in 
Parkinson's disease model mice. Furthermore, when administered to normal aged 
mice, the ZSS powder suppressed cellular senescence, reduced DNA oxidation, 
promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, and 
enhanced cognition to levels similar to those in young mice. The quantity of 
known active ingredients of ZSS, jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin was 
not proportional to the nootropic activity of ZSS. These results suggest that 
ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for the prevention of 
neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.

ObjectiveTo analyse the benefits of virtual reality in the management of balance 
and gait disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease and cognitive 
impairment.Data sourcesPubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Google 
Scholar and Epistemonikos.Review methodThis study is a systematic review 
(PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42023486083). The inclusion criteria were: 
randomised, cross-sectional, quasi-experimental controlled clinical trials 
involving patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease with a score of ≤23 on the MMSE test and age ≥60 years, and 
interventions conducted with virtual reality and conventional physiotherapy for 
the treatment of balance and gait disorders. The methodological quality and risk 
of bias assessment was performed with the PEDro scale.Results12 studies were 
included in the review (n = 476). Three studies applied virtual reality to both 
experimental and control groups, six applied virtual reality to the experimental 
group and conventional physiotherapy to the control, and three investigations 
applied virtual reality to the experimental group and no treatment to the 
control group. Virtual reality based rehabilitation significantly improved 
balance and gait, as well as cognitive level, functionality, postural control 
and mood of the patients compared to those participants who received 
conventional physiotherapy or no treatment.ConclusionStudies suggest that 
interventions based on virtual environments in older adults with early 
Alzheimer's disease can improve balance and gait impairments, postural control 
and executive function, delaying the deterioration caused by the disease. 
Furthermore, this therapy has a positive impact on cognitive and motivational 
performance in these patients.

Due to progressive cognitive loss and subsequent incapability of daily life, the 
development of novel therapeutics is urgently needed for dementia patients. We 
performed a two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis 
using summary-level statistics to identify causality between peripheral and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins and the risk of dementia. Genetic variants 
were subtracted from the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results. Wald 
ratio (WR) and inverse-variance weighted (IVW) ratio were utilized to estimate 
the causal effects of plasma and CSF proteins on dementia. Reverse MR, Steiger 
filtering, Bayesian co-localization phenotype scanning, and external validation 
were integrated to strengthen the robustness of primary MR results. After 
sensitivity analysis, six circulating proteins were identified in three dementia 
classifications, whereas no causality was found in frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD). Elevated levels of circulating C1R protein increased the odds of 
developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), while PILRA and CELA2A were estimated to 
protect against the pathogenesis of AD; genetically predicted increase of 
α-synuclein and APOE elevated the occurrence of Dementia of Lewy Bodies (DLB); 
elevated level of circulating CRP was assessed to increase the onset of vascular 
dementia (VD). Our MR analyses identified a genetically predicted association 
between circulating C1R, PILRA, and CELA2A and the risk of AD, causal estimates 
between α-syn, APOE protein, and the onset of DLB, and a robust correlation 
between CRP and the etiology of VD. This study might guide the discovery of 
disease etiology and build up a novel disease-modifying paradigm of dementia.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition 
characterised by cognitive decline and memory impairment. Recent research 
highlights the important role of hypoxia, a state of insufficient oxygen 
availability, in exacerbating AD pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through the use of a number of different search engines 
like Scopus, PubMed, Bentham, and Elsevier databases, a literature review was 
carried out for investigating the role of hypoxia mediated pathobiology in AD. 
Only peerreviewed articles published in reputable journals in English language 
were included. Conversely, non-peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, and 
editorials were excluded, along with studies lacking experimental or clinical 
relevance or those unavailable in full text.
CONCLUSION: Hypoxia exacerbates core pathological features such as oxidative 
stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
dysregulation, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. These interlinked 
mechanisms establish a self-perpetuating cycle of neuronal damage, accelerating 
disease progression. Addressing hypoxia as a modifiable risk factor offers 
potential for both prevention and treatment of AD. Exploring hypoxia and the HIF 
signalling pathway may help counteract the neuropathological and symptomatic 
effects of neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, represents a 
significant global health challenge, characterized by cognitive decline and 
neuroinflammation. Recent investigations have highlighted the critical role of 
the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD, particularly focusing on the 
influence of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolites produced by the gut 
microbiota through the fermentation of dietary fiber. Among SCFAs, butyrate has 
emerged as a crucial mediator, positively impacting various pathological 
processes associated with AD, including epigenetic regulation, neuroinflammation 
modulation, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enhanced intestinal 
integrity, regulation of brain metabolism, and interference with amyloid protein 
formation as well as tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Furthermore, distinctions 
in butyrate profile and microbial communities have been observed between AD 
patients and healthy individuals, underscoring the importance of gut microbiota 
in AD progression. This review summarizes the current understanding of the many 
functions of butyrate in reducing the consequences of AD and emphasizes the 
possibility of addressing the gut microbiota as a therapeutic approach to 
managing AD.

The present study aimed to assess the pharmacological mechanism of Salvia 
officinalis in Neurodegenerative disorders using a network pharmacology approach 
followed by molecular docking analysis. Phytoconstituents of S.officinalis were 
obtained from various databases, followed by the screening of active ingredients 
using the Swiss ADME web tool. Potential targets of active ingredients were 
identified using PubChem & SwissTargetPrediction. Genes related to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) were 
gathered using online databases. Besides, the correlation between active 
ingredient targets and disease-associated genes was linked. Networks were 
constructed, visualized, and analyzed using Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were 
performed using DAVID database. Decisively, Autodock was used for molecular 
docking. The results of network analysis identified 9 key active ingredients 
based on topological analysis of the active ingredient-candidate targets 
network. Also, the analysis revealed a shared target of 9 key active ingredients 
of S. officinalis that interacted with 133 AD-related targets whereas only 6 
active ingredients interacted with 85 and 58 targets of PD and HD respectively. 
The core genes from the network were AKT1, BACE1, CASP3, MAPK1, TNF, and IL6. 
Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that FOXO, TNF, MAPK, 
PI3K-Akt, Rap 1, and neurotrophin signalling pathways as enriched, which were 
further evaluated by molecular docking suggesting the protective role of S. 
officinalis in neurodegenerative diseases. Our research reveals the therapeutic 
benefits of S. officinalis, which might play a crucial role in modulating 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate pain network and 
periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) functional connectivity (FC) in participants 
with acute post-traumatic headache (PTH) due to mild traumatic brain injury 
(mTBI) compared to healthy controls (HC).
METHODS: Ninety-eight participants with acute PTH and 85 HC underwent 3 T 
magnetic resonance imaging. Static FC among regions of the pain matrix and 
between PAG to the rest of the brain were examined. Correlations between FC and 
clinical parameters were investigated using linear regression. PTH outcomes 
(improved or not improved) were determined at 3 months post-enrollment.
RESULTS: Stronger FC between the PAG and right somatosensory and left lingual 
areas, and weaker FC between left thalamus and left caudate were found in the 
PTH group compared to HC. Whole-brain analysis showed increased PAG FC, 
primarily with somatosensory, motor, and occipital areas of participants with 
PTH relative to HC. These differences had associations with headache frequency, 
state anxiety, and time since mTBI. A PAG FC model for PTH improvement at 
3 months had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 100%. Participants with 
PTH who did not improve at 3 months had stronger baseline FC from the PAG to the 
right temporal region and the left insula relative to the improved group or to 
HC.
CONCLUSION: PAG FC could serve as an early biomarker identifying participants 
with acute PTH at risk of developing persistent PTH.

Grandparents may provide care to grandchildren, potentially supporting cognitive 
engagement while aging. However, previous studies have shown mixed results. We 
investigated associations between grandchild caregiving and cognitive function 
among 5,005 older adults (Cohort 1) and 1,521 middle-aged adults (Cohort 2). 
Cognitive functioning was measured by the Short Portable Mental Status 
Questionnaire at baseline in 1996 and at follow-up waves from 1999 to 2015. We 
adjusted for baseline and time-varying covariates using marginal structural 
models. We found a significant dose-response relationship between caregiving 
duration and cognitive benefits in Cohort 1, with estimates ranging from 0.32 
(95% CI: 0.22, 0.42) for one wave to 1.40 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.81) for five waves of 
caregiving. Demographic analyses revealed stronger positive effects among men 
(0.71, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.79) and those with no formal education (0.69, 95% CI: 
0.58, 0.80). Cohort 2 demonstrated smaller overall effects (0.06, 95% CI: 0.05, 
0.08), with significant benefits primarily among men (0.14, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.15) 
and rural residents (0.16, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.19). These findings suggest that 
consistent grandchild caregiving may contribute to better cognitive outcomes, 
though these effects vary by demographic characteristics and age.

Cell-derived, nanoscale extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising 
tools in diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine applications. Their unique 
properties including the capability to encapsulate diverse molecular cargo as 
well as the versatility in surface functionalization make them ideal candidates 
for safe and effective vehicles to deliver a range of biomolecules including 
gene editing cassettes, therapeutic proteins, glycans, and glycoconjugate 
vaccines. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the development of EVs 
derived from mammalian and bacterial cells for use in a delivery of 
carbohydrate-based protein therapeutics and vaccines. We highlight key 
innovations in EVs' molecular design, characterization, and deployment for 
treating diseases including Alzheimer's disease, infectious diseases, and 
cancers. We discuss challenges for their clinical translation and provide 
perspectives for future development of EVs within biopharmaceutical research and 
the clinical translation landscape.

We introduce a special issue of the Journal of Neuropsychology dedicated to a 
recent paradigm shift in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Joint workgroups from 
the (US) National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) 
recently issued policy guidelines reclassifying Alzheimer's disease as a 
biological entity. These guidelines shift the onus of diagnosis in favour of 
protein biomarkers, relegating cognitive symptoms (e.g. subjective memory and 
language disorders) as supportive rather than core features. We invited experts 
in the study of Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders (ADRDs) to express 
their views on this paradigmatic shift in dementia management. In this 
editorial, we synthesize some of the main points advanced in the commentaries. 
Contributors identified the promise of blood-based biomarker testing for 
improving equitable detection of dementia in large swathes of the world 
population. This enthusiasm was tempered by concerns about the biomarker-only 
diagnostic approach, including the potential for significant harm (e.g. stigma, 
depression, suicide) caused by labelling asymptomatic older adults who might 
otherwise never behaviourally express the underlying disease pathology.

BACKGROUND: Protein Interacting with NIMA1 (PIN1) is a distinct enzyme, known as 
a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), which catalyzes the cis-trans 
isomerization of amide bonds in proteins containing 
phosphoserine/threonine-proline (pSer/Thr-Pro) motifs, presenting a unique 
therapeutic opportunity for addressing multiple disorders.
METHODS: A series of 140 thiazole compounds were created using the shape 
similarity technique with the intention of discovering effective PIN1 inhibitors 
with a new scaffold. The designed compounds were docked into the enzyme's ATP 
binding site, and the binding free energies for all docked conformations were 
calculated. The compounds were evaluated for their ADMET and drug-likeness 
properties. Following the identification of top candidates, molecular dynamics 
simulations were conducted to investigate the binding dynamics of the 
highest-scoring compound.
RESULTS: Based on computational findings, sixteen compounds were identified as 
potential PIN1 inhibitors. Among the sixteen compounds, four (S8Ba, S8Bb, S8Bd, 
and S8Bd) exhibited the most favorable ADMET profiles and robust interactions 
with key PIN1 residues. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that S8Ba and 
S8Bd exhibited the most promising activity over 100ns.
CONCLUSION: The results corroborated the docking outcomes, validating the 
selected hits as potential PIN1 inhibitors. This breakthrough could influence 
the development of therapeutic leads for combating diabetes, cancer, and 
Alzheimer's disease.

Over the past two decades, a growing number of studies have been conducted on 
the role of bidirectional communication through the gut-brain axis in the 
development of neurodegenerative diseases. These studies were driven by the 
curious fact that all of these diseases present varying degrees of intestinal 
involvement included in their wide range of symptoms. A population of cells 
belonging to the ENS, called enteric glial cells (EGCs), appears to actively 
participate in this communication between the intestine and the brain, but 
acting in a dualistic manner, sometimes in reactive gliosis releasing 
inflammatory mediators, sometimes promoting homeostasis and resilience in the 
face of inflammatory injuries. To date, the intracellular mechanisms that define 
the transcriptional profile expressed in EGCs in each situation have not yet 
been elucidated. This review proposes a discussion on: (1) the complex role of 
distinct phenotypes of enteric glial cells involved in neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD) and multiple 
sclerosis (MS); and (2) innovative strategies such as IDO/TDO inhibitors, Brazil 
nuts, caffeic acid, polyphenols, among others, that act on EGCs and have the 
potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases.

Chronic exposure to herbicides, weedicides, and pesticides is associated with 
the onset and progress of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's 
disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). 
Here, we have investigated whether quinic- and chlorogenic-acid-derived Carbon 
Quantum Dots (QACQDs and ChACQDs, respectively) protect against a (pesticide) 
paraquat-insult model of PD. Our results indicated that both types of CQDs 
intervened in the soluble-to-toxic transformation of the amyloid-forming model 
protein Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL). Furthermore, QACQDs and ChACQDs 
demonstrated antioxidant activity while remaining biocompatible in a human 
neuroblastoma-derived cell line (SH-SY5Y) up to 5 mg/ml and protected the cell 
line from the environmental neurotoxicant (paraquat). Importantly, both CQDs 
were found to protect dopaminergic neuronal ablation in a paraquat model of 
Parkinson's disease using the nematode C. elegans. Our results are significant 
because both plant-derived organic acids cross the blood-brain barrier, making 
them attractive for developing CQD architectures. Furthermore, since the 
synthesis of these CQDs was performed using green chemistry methods from 
precursor acids that cross the BBB, these engineered bionanomaterial platforms 
are tantalizing candidates for preventing neurodegenerative disorders associated 
with exposure to environmental neurotoxicants.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss, with amyloid-beta (Aβ) 
plaques and acetylcholine deficits being central pathological features. 
Inhibition of dual targets including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and beta-site 
amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) represents a promising 
strategy to address cholinergic deficits and amyloid pathology. In this study, 
we used computational approaches to evaluate 8000 tripeptides as potential dual 
inhibitors of AChE and BACE-1. Machine learning models revealed the four 
top-lead tripeptides including WHM, HMW, WMH, and HWM. Molecular docking 
simulations indicated that WHM possessed the most favorable interactions through 
hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and salt bridges with key catalytic residues in 
both enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the 
protein-ligand complexes, with WHM exhibiting the most consistent conformations 
and significant disruption of catalytic residue geometries. Free energy 
perturbation analysis further supported WHM's superior stability across both 
targets. ADMET predictions suggested moderate oral absorption and limited brain 
penetration, consistent with the typical behavior of peptide-based compounds. 
Overall, WHM demonstrated the strongest potential as a dual inhibitor of AChE 
and BACE-1, offering a promising lead for future therapeutic development in AD.

BACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is essential for many nervous system functions 
including memory, cognition and coordination, which has also been linked to a 
variety of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and Parkinson's disease (PD). Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a 
biomarker of neurologic diseases. Studies on the relationship between blood Se 
and sNfL are limited.
METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 
data were employed to perform multivariate linear regression analysis and smooth 
curve fitting in order to investigate the relationship between blood Se and 
sNfL. Utilizing subgroup analyses and interaction tests, the stability of this 
relationship between populations was evaluated.
RESULTS: sNfL and blood Se had an inverse relationship in 1,036 individuals who 
were older than 20. According to the fully adjusted model, the sNfL decreased by 
54.75 pg./mL for every unit increase in log blood Se [β = -54.75, 95% CI 
(-75.36, -34.14)]. The sNfL of individuals in the highest blood Se quartile 
decreased by 3.4 pg./mL in comparison to those in the lowest quartile 
[β = -3.40, 95% CI (-6.47, -0.32)]. This inverse association was more 
significant in those who were younger than 60 years old, male, normal weight, 
had a history of smoking and drinking.
CONCLUSION: Blood Se is inversely associated with sNfL in American adults. Our 
findings indicate that blood Se may have a potential protective effect against 
neuronal damage.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative 
disorder globally, with patient numbers expected to rise to 130 million by 2050. 
Insomnia, a prevalent comorbidity, exhibits a bidirectional relationship with 
AD: insomnia accelerates AD pathology, while AD worsens sleep disorders. This 
relationship has emerged as a key area of research. Current mechanisms involve 
oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and glymphatic system dysfunction, yet 
a comprehensive review of these processes remains absent.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a visual analysis of the relationship between Alzheimer's 
disease and insomnia using CiteSpace.
METHODS: Literature on "insomnia" and "Alzheimer's disease" published between 
January 1, 2000, and October 31, 2024, was retrieved from the Web of Science 
Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to analyze 
institutions, authors, and keywords.
RESULTS: A total of 1,907 articles were analyzed, revealing a consistent upward 
trend in publication volume. The United States and the Mayo Clinic were 
identified as leading contributors, producing 704 and 57 publications, 
respectively. Boeve Bradley F the most prolific author contributed 30 
publications. Collaboration was actively observed among countries, institutions, 
and authors. High-frequency keywords identified were "Parkinson's disease," 
"cognitive impairment," and "sleep behavior disorder." Emerging research areas 
are likely to focus on "sleep quality" and the "glymphatic system."
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to apply bibliometric analysis to identify 
three key trends in AD and insomnia research: the dominance of the United States 
and Mayo Clinic, strong international collaboration, and a focus on critical 
areas such as cognitive impairment, the glymphatic system, and sleep 
interventions. Insomnia may accelerate AD progression via multiple pathways, 
indicating that enhancing sleep quality could provide new strategies for early 
intervention. Future research should prioritize advancing the clinical 
translation of sleep interventions and investigating the mechanisms of the 
glymphatic system.

INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are strongly linked to 
cardiovascular risk factors and other health conditions such as Alzheimer's 
disease. However, there is a dearth of research on this topic in low-income 
countries and underserved populations, especially in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) where the population is aging rapidly with increasing cardiovascular 
risk factors and dementia-related diseases. This study evaluates health factors 
associated with WMH in the elderly Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), specifically 
Congolese adults.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 77 people from the DRC, participants 
underwent neuroimaging to analyze WMHs volume and completed clinical evaluation, 
laboratory-based blood exams, self-reported questionnaires, and interviews. A 
simple linear regression model was conducted to test the association between 
WMHs and potential predictors (dementia, age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, 
tobacco abuse, stroke, high cholesterol, cardiovascular medication, and alcohol 
abuse). Stepwise selection and backward elimination analyses were performed to 
obtain the final model. Finally, a multiple linear regression model was 
conducted to assess the association between WMHs and variables retained in the 
final model (dementia, sex, and age).
RESULTS: Of the 77 individuals, 47 (61%) had dementia, 40 (52.6%) were males, 
and the mean age was 73 years (± 8.0 years standard deviation). In simple linear 
regression models, WMHs was significantly associated with dementia 
(expβ1 = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.14-2.71, p-value = 0.01) though it had a weak 
association with age (expβ1 = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.05, p-value = 0.05) and sex 
(male) (expβ1 = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.43-1.01, p-value = 0.05). In multiple linear 
regression models, WMHs was statistically significantly associated with dementia 
(expβ1 = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.31-2.95, p-value =0.001), male sex (expβ2 = 0.54, 95% 
CI = 0.36-0.80, p-value = 0.003), and age (expβ3 = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.06, 
p-value = 0.03). However, WMHs was not significantly associated with common 
cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco use, 
obesity, and high cholesterol levels.
DISCUSSION: WMHs is significantly associated with dementia, sex, and age in the 
Congolese population. Understanding these predictors may improve our ability to 
diagnose, assess, and develop preventative treatments for white matter disease 
in SSA/DRC populations, where neuroimaging is difficult to obtain.

Human aging presents an evolutionary paradox: while aging rates remain constant, 
healthspan and lifespan vary widely. We address this conundrum via 
salutogenesis-the active production of health-through immune resilience (IR), 
the capacity to resist disease despite aging and inflammation. Analyzing ~17,500 
individuals across lifespan stages and inflammatory challenges, we identified a 
core salutogenic mechanism: IR centered on TCF7, a conserved transcription 
factor maintaining T-cell stemness and regenerative potential. IR integrates 
innate and adaptive immunity to counter three aging and mortality drivers: 
chronic inflammation (inflammaging), immune aging, and cellular senescence. By 
mitigating these aging mechanisms, IR confers survival advantages: At age 40, 
individuals with poor IR face a 9.7-fold higher mortality rate-a risk equivalent 
to that of 55.5-year-olds with optimal IR-resulting in a 15.5-year gap in 
survival. Optimal IR preserves youthful immune profiles at any age, enhances 
vaccine responses, and reduces burdens of cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, 
and serious infections. Two key salutogenic evolutionary themes emerge: first, 
female-predominant IR, including TCF7, likely reflects evolutionary pressures 
favoring reproductive success and caregiving; second, midlife (40-70 years) is a 
critical window where optimal IR reduces mortality by 69%. After age 70, 
mortality rates converge between resilient and non-resilient groups, reflecting 
biological limits on longevity extension. TNFα-blockers restore salutogenesis 
pathways, indicating IR delays aging-related processes rather than altering 
aging rates. By reframing aging as a salutogenic-pathogenic balance, we 
establish TCF7-centered IR as central to healthy longevity. Targeted midlife 
interventions to enhance IR offer actionable strategies to maximize healthspan 
before biological constraints limit benefits.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that 
affects more than 50 million people worldwide. One of the hallmark features of 
AD is the accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) protein in the brain. 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane-bound protein expressed in various tissues, 
including the cerebrovascular endothelium. It plays a crucial role in the efflux 
of toxic substances, including Aβ, from the brain. Aberrations in P-gp levels or 
activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting the 
accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Therefore, modulating the P-gp function 
represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD. P-gp has multiple 
substrate binding sites, creating the potential for substrates to fall into 
complementation groups based on these sites; two substrates in the same 
complementation group may compete with one other, but two substrates in 
different groups may exhibit cooperativity. Thus, a given P-gp substrate may 
interfere with Aβ efflux whereas another may promote clearance. These threats 
and opportunities, as well as other aspects of P-gp relevance to AD, are 
discussed here.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prominent neurodegenerative ailment 
characterized by the constraints of conventional therapies stemming from 
insufficient medication transport to the brain. This review examines the 
function of polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) in improving therapeutic efficacy for 
Alzheimer's disease treatment.
METHODS: We analyze the principal obstacles to Alzheimer's disease drug 
delivery: the blood-brain barrier, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and 
multidrug resistance proteins. The review examines three categories of PNCs: 
polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers, and their capacity 
to surmount these obstacles. Literature investigations used search engines like 
Pub- Med, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect.
RESULTS: PNCs exhibit superior drug delivery via better biocompatibility, 
regulated release, and targeted delivery mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrate 
the effective delivery of several pharmaceuticals, including rivastigmine and 
galantamine, resulting in enhanced cognitive outcomes in Alzheimer's disease 
models. Patent research indicates an increase in innovation for PNC-based 
Alzheimer's disease treatments.
CONCLUSION: Despite ongoing hurdles in biocompatibility and scalability, PNCs 
exhibit significant potential to transform Alzheimer's disease treatment by 
improving medication delivery across biological barriers. Current investigations 
in nanotechnology and combinatorial medicines indicate a favorable outlook for 
PNC-based medicinal strategies.

<p> The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a dynamic and highly selective interface, 
regulates the exchange of molecules between the circulatory system and the 
Central Nervous System (CNS). While it protects the brain from toxins and 
pathogens, it also restricts the delivery of therapeutic agents, posing a 
significant challenge in treating CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, 
Parkinson's disease, and glioblastoma. This manuscript explores the structural 
and functional complexity of the BBB, including the roles of tight junctions, 
adherens junctions, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells. It highlights 
the influence of drug physicochemical properties, such as lipophilicity, 
molecular weight, and hydrogen bonding, on BBB penetration. Current strategies 
to enhance drug delivery include nanotechnology-based carriers (liposomes, solid 
lipid nanoparticles, polymer-based carriers), receptor-mediated transcytosis, 
and cell-penetrating peptides. Emerging approaches like focused ultrasound with 
microbubbles, intranasal delivery, and exosome-mediated transport demonstrate 
significant potential for bypassing BBB constraints. Gene therapy, employing 
both viral and nonviral vectors, offers promise for addressing genetic CNS 
disorders. Despite advances, limitations, such as offtarget effects, limited 
delivery efficiency, and potential toxicity, remain critical barriers to 
clinical translation. Future research must prioritize multidisciplinary 
approaches integrating nanotechnology, personalized medicine, and enhanced 
understanding of BBB biology. Innovations in non-invasive, targeted delivery 
systems are essential to overcoming existing challenges and enabling effective 
treatment of CNS disorders. This review underscores the need for further 
exploration of these technologies to achieve sustained, site-specific drug 
delivery, thereby advancing therapeutic interventions for neurological diseases. 
Significance Statement: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical interface 
that protects the brain but limits drug delivery, posing challenges in treating 
CNS disorders. Advancing multidisciplinary approaches and innovative delivery 
systems is essential to overcome these limitations and enable effective 
therapies for neurological diseases.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme targeted by drugs used for the 
symptomatic treatment of cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. 
While in vitro data suggest the AChE inhibitory potential of A. fruticosa 
extracts and components such as rotenoids, in-depth mechanistic investigations 
are missing. A wide array of computational techniques, including ligand-based 
approaches, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and machine learning-assisted 
toxicity prediction were enrolled in the current study, highlighting the 
rotenoid 6α,12α-dehydrodeguelin as a promising lead for the development of AChE 
inhibitors.

Cognitive resilience (CR) contributes to the variability in risk for developing 
and progressing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) among individuals. Beyond genetics, 
recent studies highlight the critical role of lifestyle factors in enhancing CR 
and delaying cognitive decline. DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mechanism 
influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, including CR-related 
lifestyle factors, offers a promising pathway for understanding the biology of 
CR. We studied DNAm changes associated with the Resilience Index (RI), a 
composite measure of lifestyle factors, using blood samples from the Healthy 
Brain Initiative (HBI) cohort. After corrections for multiple comparisons, our 
analysis identified 19 CpGs and 24 differentially methylated regions 
significantly associated with the RI, adjusting for covariates age, sex, APOE 
ε4, and immune cell composition. The RI-associated methylation changes are 
significantly enriched in pathways related to lipid metabolism, synaptic 
plasticity, and neuroinflammation, and highlight the connection between 
cardiovascular health and cognitive function. By identifying RI-associated DNAm, 
our study provided an alternative approach to discovering future targets and 
treatment strategies for AD, complementary to the traditional approach of 
identifying disease-associated variants directly. Furthermore, we developed a 
Methylation-based Resilience Score (MRS) that successfully predicted future 
cognitive decline in an external dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), even after accounting for age, sex, APOE ε4, 
years of education, baseline diagnosis, and baseline MMSE score. Our findings 
are particularly relevant for a better understanding of epigenetic architecture 
underlying cognitive resilience. Importantly, the significant association 
between baseline MRS and future cognitive decline demonstrated that DNAm could 
be a predictive marker for AD, laying the foundation for future studies on 
personalized AD prevention.

BACKGROUND: The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are derivatives of the 
arachidonic acid metabolism with anti-inflammatory activities. However, their 
efficacy is limited due to the rapid hydrolysis by soluble epoxide hydrolase 
(sEH). Inhibition of sEH has been shown to stabilize the EETs and reduce 
neuroinflammation in Aβ mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
role of the sEH-EET signaling pathway in other CNS cell types and 
neurodegenerative conditions are less understood.
METHODS: Here we investigated the mechanisms and functional role of the sEH-EET 
axis in tauopathy by treating PS19 mice with a small molecule sEH inhibitor TPPU 
and by crossing the PS19 mice with Ephx2 (gene encoding sEH) knockout mice. This 
was followed by single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq), biochemical and 
immunohistochemical analysis, and behavioral assessments. Additionally, we 
examined the effects of the sEH-EET pathway in primary microglia cultures and 
human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons exhibiting 
seeding-induced Tau inclusions.
RESULTS: sEH inhibition improved cognitive function, rescued neuronal cell loss, 
and reduced Tau pathology and microglial reactivity. snRNA-seq revealed that 
TPPU treatment upregulated genes involved in actin cytoskeleton and excitatory 
synaptic pathways. Treatment of human iPSC-derived neurons with TPPU enhanced 
synaptic density without affecting Tau accumulation, suggesting a 
cell-autonomous neuroprotective effect of sEH blockade. Furthermore, sEH 
inhibition reversed disease-associated and interferon-responsive microglial 
states in PS19 mice, while EET supplementation promoted Tau phagocytosis and 
clearance in primary microglia cultures.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that sEH blockade or EET augmentation 
confers therapeutic benefit in neurodegenerative tauopathies by simultaneously 
targeting neuronal and microglial pathways.
